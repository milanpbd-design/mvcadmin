        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Buprenorphine is an opiate analgesic that is used for pain control in dogs, cats, horses, and some exotic and zoo species. It has high binding affinity but lower efficacy (lower ceiling) than pure mu- receptor agonists such as morphine. Buprenorphine has been shown to be effective in animal studies for treating postoperative pain. Duration of analgesia based on plasma values in animals is 3–4 hours, but it may be longer clinically because of slow dissociation from binding sites and higher affinity for the mu- receptor or longer half- life in the CNS. Duration of effect has not been established for all indications in well- controlled studies and has been variable. After injection, it may have a longer time to the onset of effect than other opiates. In cats, the low doses (0.01–0.02 mg/kg, or 10–20 mcg/kg) given by the IM or IV route are more effective than the SQ route. Studies using the SQ route in cats used higher doses. Higher doses in cats may produce a longer duration of action. For example, a dose of 0.02 mg/kg has a duration of 6–12 hours, but higher doses of 0.12 or 0.24 mg/kg have a duration of 24 hours. In cats, it has been administered for transmucosal absorption (buccal administration) at a dose of 20 mcg/kg (0.02 mg/kg) and reported to be effective in some studies. However, other studies have shown lower absorption of 23%–32% from transmucosal delivery in cats and lower efficacy; therefore, higher doses of 0.04 mg/ kg\t(40\tmcg/kg)\ttransmucosal\tdelivery\tmay\tbe\tneeded\tq8h\tto\tcontrol\tpain\tin\tmany cats.

The patch has a slow onset (17 hours of lag time) but a duration of 7 days. However, a 35- mcg/h patch in cats did not produce antinociceptive effects, and plasma drug levels were not detected until 36 hours after placement of the patch. Buprenorphine buccal film (Belbuca) is available in various sizes (see the Formulation section) for application to the buccal membrane in people for relief of pain. However, these film strips have not been evaluated in animals. The oral transmucosal tablets have been administered to cats after first dissolving in water or simple syrup.

In horses, the doses that are analgesic are likely to produce adverse effects (excitement and locomotor activity), which limits the use in horses unless it is administered with sedatives and other analgesics. The adverse effects in horses persist longer than the analgesic effects. In people, buprenorphine analgesia has been enhanced with the addition of small doses of naloxone (0.001–0.1 mcg/kg), but this effect has not been investigated in animals. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Adverse effects are similar to other opiate agonists, but there may be less respiratory depression. Sedation is common. Dependency from chronic use of buprenorphine may be less than with pure agonists. The lethal dose in dogs (80 mg/kg) is much higher than the therapeutic dose. In horses, restlessness, excitatory reactions, head shaking, pawing, shifting leg movements, decreased intestinal motility, and increased locomotor activity are likely and may persist for several hours.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Buprenorphine is used for analgesia, often in combination with other analgesics or in conjunction with general anesthesia. It has been used safely with acepromazine and alpha 2 agonists as a pre- anesthetic. It has been safely used for pain relief in animals in conjunction with NSAIDs. It is longer acting than morphine and only partially reversed by naloxone. When administration is intended to be buccal (transmucosal), it is important that the entire dose be applied to the oral mucosa and not swallowed. Ingested drug will not be effective (only 3%–6% oral absorption). Therefore, as the dose increases, the volume also increases, and there is a higher likelihood that some of the drug will be lost from the mouth or swallowed (e.g., at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg to cats, the volume necessary for administration is 0.45\tmL\tper\taverage\tcat).

It can be used, often with other agents, for sedation in patients with anxiety or when sedation is needed. In dogs, at doses of 0.4 mg/kg, butorphanol produces analgesia for a duration of 1 hour or less. As an antitussive, it is more potent than morphine (4×) and codeine (100×).

The limited experience shows that for joint pain in dogs, it is not as\teffective\tas\toral\tNSAIDs.\tCodeine,\tmorphine,\tand\tother\topiates\tin\tdogs\thave rapid clearance and short half- lives. Therefore, even if absorption is adequate, the duration of action is short, and clinical effectiveness in dogs may be questionable. There is little evidence available for the use in cats. Oral codeine (≈2 mg/kg) did not produce antinociceptive effects in research cats. There is some evidence that horses are capable of conversion of codeine to morphine, which may be useful for treating pain in horses. However, the clinical effectiveness in horses has not been examined. Precautionary Information",

Doses listed for analgesia are considered initial doses; individual patients may need higher doses depending on degree of tolerance or pain threshold. When administering acetaminophen–codeine combinations, the high- dose tablet (containing 60 mg codeine) tends to cause sedation in dogs (body weight 20–30 kg), and the lower dose (containing 30 mg) is recommended. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Monitor patient’s heart rate and respiration.

However, it has been effective in one study in dogs with syringomyelia. In cats, it has also been used to reduce anxiety in cats prior to traveling, visits to the veterinarian, or other stressful events with evidence from clinical studies that it may be helpful for this indication. For this use, administer 100 mg per cat (≈20–30 mg/kg) 90 minutes prior to a stressful event (e.g., visit to a veterinary office). The peak effect occurs in 2–3 hours. This use may decrease stress- related behavior and aggression and improve compliance of cats. In dogs, gabapentin has gained attention, as adjunctive treatment, for treating anxiety, phobias, panic disorders, and compulsive disorders. It is used when other agents (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) have not been effective and has been used concurrently with SSRIs or TCAs). In horses, gabapentin has been used to treat laminitis and other pain syndromes, but efficacy has not been shown in well- controlled studies. The use is based on anecdotal or small observational case studies. It has low and variable oral absorption in horses, and the doses have varied widely (5–20 mg/kg two or three times daily). In calves, it has a long half- life but is not effective for analgesia in dehorning procedures. G G When used to treat epilepsy, gabapentin (or pregabalin) is rarely used as a single agent but is considered when the seizures have become refractory to other drugs. Neurologists consider gabapentin an “add- on” for treating seizures in animals, but it is not very effective when used alone. When included in a regimen as an add- on, it is not as effective as zonisamide or levetiracetam. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Sedation and ataxia are reported adverse effects. As dose increases in dogs (see the dosing section), sedation is more likely. In people, a withdrawal syndrome from abrupt discontinuation has been described, but it is not reported in animals. However, based on this concern in people, gradual withdrawal should be considered. When high doses are administered (see the dosing section), adverse effects include ataxia, decreased appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some of these effects are transient, but if they persist, lower the dose by one-half or consider another alternative. The oral solution contains xylitol, which is an artificial sweetener that can be toxic to dogs and produces hypoglycemia and liver injury with high doses exceeding 0.1 g/kg. With standard doses of gabapentin oral solution, the toxic level of xylitol is not likely to be exceeded, but one should be cautious about adding other drugs that also contain xylitol.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Gabapentin has been used in some animals as an anticonvulsant when they are refractory to other drugs. It can be used with other drugs such as phenobarbital and bromide. It also has been used to treat neuropathic pain syndromes and can be used with NSAIDs and opioids. Efficacy for each of these indications is anecdotal or based on small uncontrolled observational studies; there are no controlled studies published to show efficacy for treating pain syndromes in animals. Gabapentin has been administered to cats to reduce anxiety and fear associated with stressful events. For this use, administer gabapentin orally 2–3 hours prior to the anticipated stressful event.

        "notes": "Instructions for Use Hydromorphone may be used interchangeably with morphine or oxymorphone, provided that doses are adjusted for potency differences. Administration to cats has been more effective when injected intravenously, rather than intramuscularly or subcutaneously, and resulted in faster onset with fewer adverse effects. Oral tablets and solution are available for human use, but use has not been reported for animals. It is uncertain if oral forms are absorbed sufficiently for clinical use in animals. In addition to sedative and analgesic uses, hydromorphone also has been used to induce vomiting by stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This has been used for the purpose of treating an animal that has ingested a toxin. It is more effective as an emetic in dogs and cats when injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly rather than intravenously. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Monitor patient’s heart rate and respiration. Although bradycardia rarely needs to be treated when it is caused by an opioid, atropine or glycopyrrolate can be administered if needed.

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Naloxone is used to reverse the effects of opiate agonists on receptors. Naloxone is usually the first drug of choice for reversing overdoses, toxicity, or adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects such as dysphoria or excitement. It will reverse effects of morphine, oxymorphone, butorphanol, hydromorphone, fentanyl, and other opioids. It is less effective for reversing buprenorphine because buprenorphine is a partial agonist. When administering naloxone to reverse opiates, the dose may be titrated gradually to achieve the optimum degree of reversal. The dose for full reversal is typically 0.04 mg/kg (40 mcg/kg), but doses this high may not be needed, and smaller doses (producing partial reversal) can be used when it is necessary to reduce dysphoria or excitement, without reducing the analgesic effects. At very low doses (one fifth of the dose needed to fully reverse opiates), it has been used to treat opioid- induced side effects such as vomiting, nausea, and dysphoria. (This use has been referred to as microdosing.) A formulation for wildlife use (Trexonil) is more concentrated and used to reverse tranquilization in wild animals. Naloxone may have some temporary benefit for behavior modification (e.g., to suppress compulsive disorders), but the effects are short lived. For example, in horses, it temporarily decreases crib biting, but the duration of action is short. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Tachycardia and hypertension have been reported in people. In animals, reversal of opioid may precipitate a severe reaction that includes high blood pressure, excitement, pain, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Because of these reactions, less than a full reversal often is recommended unless the reversal is needed for a life- threatening  problem.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Administration may have to be individualized based on response in each patient. Naloxone’s duration of action is short in animals (60 minutes), and the dose may have to be repeated when treating an overdose of a long- acting opioid. Start at the low end of the dosage rate and increase the dose to effect. Higher doses may be needed to reverse drugs that are mixed agonists–antagonists such as butorphanol or buprenorphine compared with reversing drugs that are pure agonists. Low doses may be used to reduce opioid- induced dysphoria in animals. For this use, start with the 0.04- mg/mL solution and administer increments of 1 mL every 30 seconds until vocalization or signs of dysphoria stop. A dose of 0.01 mg/kg IV has been given for this purpose without losing analgesic effects. As a general guideline, a dose of 1 mL (0.4 mg) reverses 1.5 mg of oxymorphone, 15 mg of morphine, 100 mg of meperidine, and 0.4 mg of fentanyl. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Naloxone is used to reverse opioid analgesic drugs. When opioids are reversed in some animals, serious reactions may occur. In some patients, changes in blood pressure, tachycardia, and discomfort may result.

It is an alternative analgesic to pure opiate analgesics and NSAIDs in patients that require treatment for mild to moderate pain. In people, it is regarded as a mild analgesic, but the pharmacokinetics of tramadol are different in people compared with animals, and clinical effects in humans cannot necessarily be extrapolated to animals. In animal studies, both clinical and experimental, the results have been variable and inconsistent to demonstrate its effectiveness as an analgesic. The studies have varied in the dose, route, and pain stimulus evaluated. There has been some evidence of analgesia after administration for treating pain associated with elective surgery, but there is a lack of evidence for T an antinociceptive effect when experimental models of pain have been used. When oral administration was tested for treating osteoarthritis in dogs, efficacy has been poor or produced only mild benefit. When tested in dogs for treating pain from orthopedic surgery, the results have been inconsistent with some studies showing little benefit and other studies showing a mild benefit.

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Azithromycin is indicated for treatment of bacterial infections. It also has been used in people for a variety of respiratory infections in which the benefits are believed to be partially, if not predominantly, caused by the immunomodulatory properties. Antimicrobial spectrum is primarily against gram- positive bacteria. Azithromycin is not recommended for serious gram- negative infections. It may be used to treat infections caused by Mycoplasma and other atypical organisms. Azithromycin has been used to treat intracellular organisms because of its ability to concentrate in leukocytes. One of the uses has been to treat infections caused by Rhodococcus equi in foals. However, in one comparative study, clarithromycin plus rifampin had better clinical success in foals than azithromycin plus rifampin. In\tfoals,\tazithromycin,\tadministered\tat\ta\tdosage\tof\t10\tmg/kg\tq48h\toral\tduring the first 2 weeks after birth has been used prophylactically to decrease Rhodococcus spp. infection in foals at high risk (farms with high endemic risk). In horses, azithromycin also has been used to treat proliferative enteritis caused by Lawsonia intracellularis. Azithromycin has been used in cats to treat upper respiratory infections. There are no controlled clinical trials to document success for this use; however, this treatment has been common among veterinarians. Azithromycin administered to cats with infections caused by Chlamydophila felis (formerly Chlamydia psittaci), at 10–15 mg/kg once daily for 3 days and thereafter two times per week, was not effective for eliminating the organism, although clinical signs improved (perhaps via the immunomodulatory effects). However, azithromycin was not effective in cats for treatment of Mycoplasma haemofelis (hemobartonellosis). When azithromycin was administered to dogs with pyoderma at either 10 mg/ kg on day 1 followed by 5 mg/kg on days 2 through 5 or 5 mg/kg given 2 days/ wk for 3 weeks, the response was equal statistically to cephalexin at 22 mg/kg twice daily. However, azithromycin is not a preferred drug for treating pyoderma in dogs. In dairy calves, azithromycin administration significantly suppressed shedding of Cryptosporidium parvum and improved clinical signs. However, in cattle and pigs, other injectable long- acting macrolides approved for those species are recommended over azithromycin. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Azithromycin has a history of a favorable safety profile after many years of use in people. However, because it is not approved for animals, adverse reaction reports are few and inconsistent. Severe adverse effects to azithromycin have not been reported in publications in which it was administered to animals. However, vomiting is likely with high doses. Diarrhea may occur in some patients. Changes in the consistency of the feces and diarrhea have been reported in horses that were administered recommended doses. The long- term safety in adult horses is not known. A warning occurs on the human label warning of potentially serious cardiac arrhythmias from azithromycin use, but these problems have not been observed in animals.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Azithromycin may be better tolerated than erythromycin. A primary difference from other antibiotics is the high intracellular concentrations achieved and long half- life that allows for intermittent administration. Although azithromycin has been commonly used for infections in dogs and cats, there is insufficient clinical trial evidence for most of these uses.

Cross- reactivity between penicillin allergy and cephalosporin allergy is low. Rare bleeding disorders have been known to occur with some cephalosporins.

Because exposure to humans can potentially produce severe consequences, veterinarians should caution pet owners about handling the medications and to ensure that accidental exposure to humans does not occur at home (e.g., to young children). Drug Interactions Chloramphenicol is notorious for producing drug- drug interactions. Chloramphenicol is a CYP 450 and CYP2B11 inhibitor and possibly other CYP enzymes in dogs. As such, chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of other drugs that are metabolized by the same metabolic enzymes. Chloramphenicol inhibits the metabolism of opiates, barbiturates, propofol, phenytoin, salicylate, and perhaps other drugs. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering other drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, particularly anesthetics, concurrently with chloramphenicol.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Chloramphenicol has been used to treat infections caused by a broad spectrum of organisms, including gram- positive cocci, gram- negative bacilli (including Enterobacteriaceae), anaerobic bacteria, and Rickettsia. However, effectiveness against all these organisms has not been verified in clinical studies. Chloramphenicol has been used to treat infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to other common drugs (e.g., MRS in dogs). Chloramphenicol has been used in horses for oral treatment of a variety of infections. However, recent pharmacokinetic analysis have demonstrated that chloramphenicol has a short half-life, highly variable oral absorption, and not likely to reach\teffective\tlevels\tconsidered\t“susceptible”\twhen\ttested\tusing\tcurrent\tsusceptibility breakpoints.

Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Chloramphenicol has a narrow margin of safety. High doses can produce toxicity in dogs and cats. GI disturbances are rather common. A decrease in protein synthesis in the bone marrow may be associated with prolonged treatment. The effect on the bone marrow is most prominent in cats, especially after 14 days of treatment, but is uncommon in dogs. Bone marrow suppression in animals is reversible. Idiosyncratic aplastic anemia has been described in humans. The incidence of aplastic anemia is rare, but the consequences are severe because it is irreversible. The risk of human exposure led to the ban of chloramphenicol use in food animals. Another problem recognized in dogs is peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism is unknown but may be due to de- myelination of nerve fibers. This causes ataxia and weakness, particularly in the hind limbs of dogs. Large- breed dogs may be more susceptible to this problem. The peripheral neuropathy is reversible if the drug is discontinued.",

Clarithromycin administered to animals may decrease the clearance of other co- administered drugs.\tFor\texample,\tclarithromycin\tdecreased\tclearance\tof\tcyclosporine\tand increased oral absorption of cyclosporine in cats. Clarithromycin is often administered with rifampin for treatment of horses with R. equi infections. Because of induction of enzymes and transporters, co- administration with rifampin decreases plasma drug concentrations of clarithromycin by greater than 90%. (See Rifampin for more details.)",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses The most common use in people is for treatment of Helicobacter gastritis and respiratory infections, where it has retained activity against most respiratory tract pathogens (e.g., Streptococcus spp., mycoplasma, chlamydia). In small animals, clarithromycin has been used for indications such as skin infections and respiratory infections, but the use in small animals is not common. In foals, clarithromycin has been used for treatment of infections caused by Rhodococcus equi (in combination with rifampin). It is more active than other macrolides against R. equi and produced better clinical success than azithromycin. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects The most common adverse effects from clarithromycin and related drugs are diarrhea and nausea. Many animals may develop soft feces or mild diarrhea. In studies in healthy foals, diarrhea was uncommon from oral doses and was self- limiting. However, if diarrhea becomes severe, treatment should be discontinued.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Clarithromycin should be given twice daily to animals because of a short half- life and need for a long time above the MIC. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests In the absence of a specific value for clarithromycin, use susceptibility for erythromycin to guide use of clarithromycin. Although the CLSI- derived breakpoint for susceptible bacteria is 1 mcg/mL, cures have been observed when treating respiratory pathogens with MIC values as high as 8 mcg/mL, which is attributed to high respiratory concentrations achieved. MIC values for R. equi were 0.12 mcg/mL.

        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions Do not administer to animals with compromised renal function, renal insufficiency, kidney disease, or renal failure. Kidney disease impairs renal clearance of gentamicin and increases the risk of kidney injury. Use in young animals is acceptable, but higher doses may be necessary. Drug Interactions When gentamicin is used with anesthetic agents, neuromuscular blockade is possible. Do not mix in vial or syringe with other antibiotics; otherwise, inactivation can occur. Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are potentiated by loop diuretics such as furosemide.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Gentamicin has a rapid, bactericidal action and is indicated for acute serious infections, such as those caused by gram- negative bacilli. Gentamicin has been administered IM, SQ, and IV. It is not absorbed after oral administration, and this use is restricted to labeled use in pigs for treatment of diarrhea. Gentamicin, like other aminoglycosides, can be used with beta- lactam antibiotics because it broadens the spectrum when used with drugs such as penicillins, ampicillin, or cephalosporins. Although gentamicin is generally active against most gram- negative bacilli, amikacin is more consistently active against resistant strains. The use should be avoided in food- producing animals because of risk of residues. The only approved use in food animals is oral treatment in pigs for swine dysentery. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Nephrotoxicity is the most dose- limiting toxicity. Ensure that patients have adequate fluid and electrolyte balance during therapy. Electrolyte depletion increases the risk of nephrotoxicity. Kidney injury is increased with persistently high trough concentrations. High levels of calcium and protein in the diet decrease the risk of nephrotoxicity. Ototoxicity and vestibulotoxicity also are possible but have not been often reported in animals. With high doses, neuromuscular toxicity is possible, although rare.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Dosing regimens in most animals emphasize once- daily administration to maximize efficacy and decrease adverse effects. Once- daily administration is as efficacious and possibly more effective than administration more than once per day. The once daily treatment is also safer because of less kidney exposure, as multiple treatments. Activity against some bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) may be enhanced when combined with a beta- lactam antibiotic, such as ceftazidime, but there is no strong evidence that it is synergistic with beta- lactam antibiotics when treating other bacteria. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Susceptibility\ttesting:\tThe\tCLSI\tminimum\tinhibitory\tconcentration\tbreakpoint for susceptibility testing is ≤2 mcg/mL. Monitor blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urine for evidence of renal toxicity. Blood levels can be monitored to measure for problems with systemic clearance. When monitoring trough levels in patients that are administered gentamicin once per day, the trough levels should be near or below the limit of detection. Alternatively, measure half- life from samples taken at 1 hour and 2–4 hours postdosing.

N It is bactericidal with a broad spectrum of activity except against streptococci and anaerobic bacteria. Neomycin differs from other aminoglycosides because it is only administered topically or orally. Systemic absorption is minimal from oral absorption. Contraindications and Precautions Use neomycin cautiously in animals with kidney disease. If oral absorption occurs because of compromised mucosal integrity, absorption may occur from the intestine. Do not use longer than 14 days. Neomycin has been mixed with water and\tinjected,\tbut\tthis\tpractice\tis\tstrongly\tdiscouraged.

It is often combined with other antibiotics (triple antibiotics) in ointments for topical treatment of superficial infections. It is also used for oral administration to produce a local effect in the intestine for treatment of intestinal infections (colibacillosis). It is given orally, and because it is not absorbed systemically, it produces a local effect limited to the intestinal lumen. Precautionary Information Indications and Clinical Uses Neostigmine is used as an antidote for anticholinergic intoxication. It is also used as a treatment for myasthenia gravis, treatment (antidote) for neuromuscular blockade, and treatment for ileus. It also has been used as a treatment of urinary retention—such as the retention observed in postoperative patients—by increasing the tone of bladder smooth muscle. In ruminants, it has been used to stimulate rumen and intestinal motility. In horses, it has been used to stimulate GI motility, but results have been mixed. It may increase intestinal motility and increase fecal output but may not increase stomach emptying. For these uses, there are no clinical studies to guide the use and doses administered.

Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Culture and sensitivity testing: CLSI breakpoints to define mec- A–mediated resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is a MIC ≥4 mcg/mL, and the zone size is ≤10 mm. All other Staphylococcus spp. with mec- A- mediated resistance, including S. pseudintermedius (e.g., MRSP), are disk diffusion ≤17 mm and MIC ≥0.5 mcg/mL. If staphylococci are resistant to oxacillin, they should be interpreted as resistant to all cephalosporins and penicillins regardless of sensitivity result.

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Oxytetracycline is used to treat infections of the respiratory tract (pneumonia), urinary tract, soft tissues, and skin. It is used for infections caused by a wide spectrum of bacteria except that resistance is common among gram- negative bacilli of enteric origin and staphylococci. One of the most common uses is in cattle for treatment of bovine respiratory disease caused by Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Histophilus somni. In pigs, tetracyclines have been used to treat atrophic rhinitis, pneumonic pasteurellosis, and Mycoplasma infections. In small animals, doxycycline, rather than oxytetracycline, is used as a treatment for Rickettsia spp. and Ehrlichia spp. infections. In horses, oxytetracycline has been administered to treat equine piroplasmosis caused by Theileria equi but was not effective for Babesia caballi. Oxytetracycline has been used for treating Potomac fever in horses caused by Neorickettsia risticii, as well as respiratory and soft tissue infections. In newborn horses, oxytetracycline has been administered at high doses for the purpose of correcting angular limb deformities. The dosages have been as high as 50–70 mg/ kg\tIV\tq48h.\tThis\teffect\tmay\tbe\tcaused\tby\ta\tdecrease\tin\tthe\tviscoelastic\tproperties\tin the tendons of young animals. Because this produces tendon or ligament laxity, it may correct angular limb deformities in young foals. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Tetracyclines have produced kidney injury, but this has been rare with recommended doses and current formulations. Toxicity reported in older publications was attributed to outdated formulations that produced nephrotoxic degradation products. This ingredient that caused toxicity is no longer present, and this problem has been eliminated. Azotemia can be seen with high doses, which is attributed to inhibition of protein synthesis in mammalian cells. Therefore, this is caused by inhibition of protein synthesis with high doses rather than a direct nephrotoxic effect. At very high doses, oxytetracycline can injure other organs (e.g., liver) or cause metabolic acidosis, hemoglobinemia, or myoglobinemia, and the kidneys are injured as a consequence. Tetracyclines can affect bone and teeth formation in young animals, but this is usually not a problem with short- term administration. It was not observed when administered for two doses for treatment of angular limb deformities in young foals. Tetracyclines have caused drug fever in cats, but the mechanism is unknown. Oxytetracycline administration to horses has been associated with colic and diarrhea because of changes in the intestinal bacterial flora.",

Although oral preparations are available, oral absorption is poor. For example, oral absorption of 44 mg/kg in dogs was variable and too low to produce therapeutic effects. In pigs, oral absorption was only 4% (compared with chlortetracycline, which is 13%). Most pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with injectable oxytetracycline.

Instructions for Use Oral dose forms are intended for large animal use and there are no tablets for small animals. Use of injectable long- acting forms has not been studied in small animals. Use of tetracyclines in small animals has primarily relied on doxycycline or minocycline. For large animals, there is both a conventional and a long-acting formulation of oxytetracycline. The long- acting formulation contains a viscosity excipient used to prolong the absorption from the injection site. One such excipient is 2- pyrrolidone. When using long- acting formulations, the long- acting properties only apply to IM use,\tnot\tIV\tadministration.\tWhen\tproducts\tthat\tare\tlong\tacting\tare\tcompared\twith conventional injectable products, the long- acting products usually allow for longer dose intervals. However, in pigs, there were no differences in duration of plasma concentrations when equivalent doses were administered. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Susceptibility testing: CLSI breakpoints for susceptible respiratory pathogens are ≤2 mcg/mL and ≤0.5 mcg/mL for cattle and swine, respectively. For other organisms, the breakpoints are ≤2 mcg/mL for streptococci and ≤4 for other organisms.

Infusions ranging from 1000\tto\t10,000\tunits/kg\t(a\tcommon\tdose\tis\t6000\tunits/kg,\tequivalent\tto\t1\tmg/kg) administered q8h. These infusions have been shown to be safe and effective for treating endotoxemia in horses. The action is attributed to the cationic portion of polymyxin B binding to the anionic lipid A portion of this endotoxin. This effectively renders the endotoxin inactive, thereby decreasing adverse effects attributed to gram- negative endotoxin. This effect also has been demonstrated in an experimental model of feline endotoxemia in which it had antiendotoxin effects in vivo. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Intramuscular injections cause pain. Because of its ability to bind to phospholipid membranes and cause injury, the most severe adverse reaction is caused by renal injury.

        "notes": "Instructions for Use Pharmacokinetic and experimental studies have been conducted in small animals but not in clinical studies. Use of tetracyclines in small animals has primarily been replaced by doxycycline or minocycline. In cattle, pigs, and other large animals, the most commonly administered tetracycline is oxytetracycline, either in feed or water, or by injection. The most common oral tetracycline in horses is doxycycline or minocycline. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Tetracycline can be tested as the class representative for susceptibility to chlortetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, and oxytetracycline. Organisms that are susceptible to tetracycline are often susceptible to the other tetracyclines. However, some organisms that are intermediate or resistant to tetracycline may be susceptible to doxycycline or minocycline or both. Susceptibility testing: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints for sensitive organisms are ≤2 mcg/mL for streptococci and ≤4 mcg/ mL for other organisms, based on the human breakpoint. However, on the basis of plasma concentrations achieved in animals, the human breakpoint cannot always be extrapolated to predict susceptibility of pathogens from animals. When testing Staphylococcus spp. from dogs, the breakpoint for susceptible isolates is ≤0.25 mcg/ mL. When using tetracycline to test for susceptibility to oxytetracycline in pathogens from cattle, use a breakpoint of ≤2 mcg/mL for susceptible bacteria. When using tetracycline to test for susceptibility to oxytetracycline in pathogens from swine, use a breakpoint of ≤0.5 mcg/mL for susceptible bacteria.

The infections treated with tobramycin include pneumonia, soft tissue infections, and sepsis. Like many off- label antibiotics in animals, the use in animals has been primarily derived from empirical use and from PK–PD information. Tobramycin has also been used topically. It has been used in nebulizing solutions for respiratory infections. For nebulization, there is a unique formulation used in people (Tobi) that is without preservatives and is intended to treat infections caused by P. aeruginosa in the airways of human cystic fibrosis patients.

Drug Interactions There are no known drug interactions with fluralaner. It has been administered safely with vaccines, anthelmintics, antibiotics, and corticosteroids. It should not be used concurrently with other drugs in the isooxazoline class because this may increase the risk of neurologic problems. F Fluticasone Propionate 389",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Fluralaner, like the other isooxazolines is active against fleas, mites, and ticks. After oral administration or topical application, it can start killing fleas within 2–4 hours, with practically 100% of the fleas killed by 8 hours. The chew tablet for dogs has an approved indication for killing adult fleas and to prevent flea infestations (Ctenocephalides felis). It is also approved for treatment and control of tick infestations. Because of this action, fluralaner can reduce the risk that these vectors may pose for disease transmission. For example, it may prevent infections caused by Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and Babesia canis. The approved label indication for fluralaner is treatment of fleas and ticks, but extralabel uses, using the approved label dose, have included treatment of generalized demodicosis caused by Demodex canis. In a clinical study, there were greater reductions in mites from treatment with fluralaner compared with treatment with  moxidectin and imidacloprid . A single dose was effective for eliminating sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) in dogs. It has also been effective for eliminating ear mites (Otodectes cynotis) in dogs and cats. The proper use of fluralaner involves administration of an oral chew tablets, administered with or without food, or application of a topical solution. A topical solution containing both fluralaner and moxidectin is available for cats (Bravecto Plus) for prevention of heartworm, roundworms, hookworms, and fleas and ticks. Exotic species: There have been successful accounts of treatment in zoo or exotic species, without adverse effects, such as rabbits, bears, and other zoo mammals. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Adverse effects have been rare from administration of fluralaner. It has been safe in dogs at least 6 months of age. Collie breeds and other herding breeds with genetic mutations of the MDR gene or ABCB1 gene can be treated safely with fluralaner. It can also be used with other ectoparasiticides such as ivermectin and milbemycin. Adverse effects reported from the manufacturer’s safety studies (some at high doses) of the chewable tablet include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and reduced appetite. According to the manufacturer, it should not be used in puppies or kittens younger than 6 months of age, but they performed safety studies in puppies 8–9 weeks of age at five times the clinical dose and there were no adverse effects. For the topical solution, the most common adverse effects included vomiting, hair loss, diarrhea, lethargy, decreased appetite, and moist dermatitis or rash and scabs or ulcerated lesions on the skin. It was safe in adult cats and kittens older than 6 months of age. In safety studies in kittens at least 11–13 weeks of age, it was safe at five times the dose. There is a concern about neurologic adverse effects, including seizures, from administration of isooxazolines in dogs. This has been reported primarily with sarolaner, but the manufacturer of fluralaner warns that it should be used cautiously in dogs or cats with a history of seizures. In cats, neurologic problems were observed in 2 of 244 cats involved with a field study.",

        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions Do not administer to animals younger than 6 weeks of age. Animals with high numbers of microfilaremia may show adverse reactions to high doses. If dogs are sensitive to ivermectin (see earlier list of breeds), they may be sensitive to other drugs in this class (other avermectins). Ivermectin at approved clinical doses for treatment of endoparasites or heartworm prevention has been safe in pregnant animals. At high doses used for treating demodicosis, safety during pregnancy is not known, but there have been no reports of teratogenic effects. In the most sensitive laboratory animal (mouse), the lowest dose that is teratogenic is 400\tmcg/kg.\tDogs\twith\tthe\tABCB1 (MDR) mutation may also be sensitive to other drugs such as loperamide, milbemycin, moxidectin, and anticancer drugs. Drug Interactions Except for low doses used for heartworm prevention, do not administer with drugs that could potentially increase the penetration of ivermectin across the blood–brain barrier. Such drugs include ketoconazole, itraconazole, cyclosporine, and calcium- channel blockers. Do not administer with spinosad (Comfortis, Trifexis) because it may potentiate toxicity. I",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Ivermectin is used in horses for the treatment and control of large strongyles (adult) (Strongylus vulgaris, Strongylus edentatus, and Triodontophorus spp.), small strongyles (adult and fourth- stage larvae) (Cyathostomum spp., Cylicocyclus spp., Cylicostephanus spp.), pinworms (adult and fourth- stage larvae) (Oxyuris equi), large roundworms (adult) (Parascaris equorum), hairworms (adult) (Trichostrongylus axei),  large- mouth stomach worms (adult) (Habronema muscae), neck threadworms (microfilariae) (Onchocerca spp.), and stomach bots (Gastrophilus spp.). In cattle, it is used for treatment and control of GI nematodes (adults and fourth- stage larvae) (Haemonchus placei, Ostertagia ostertagi) (including inhibited larvae), Ostertagia lyrata, T. axei, T. colubriformis, Cooperia oncophora, Cooperia punctata, Cooperia pectinata, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Nematodirus helvetianus (adults only), Nematodirus spathiger (adults only), Bunostomum phlebotomum; lungworms (adults and fourth- stage larvae) (Dictyocaulus viviparus); grubs (parasitic stages) (Hypoderma bovis, H. lineatum); sucking lice (Linognathus vituli, Haematopinus eurysternus, Solenopotes capillatus); and mites (scabies) (Psoroptes ovis [syn. P. communis var. bovis], Sarcoptes scabiei var. bovis). In pigs, it is used for treatment and control of GI roundworms (adults and fourth- stage larvae) large roundworm, Ascaris suum; red stomach worm, Hyostrongylus rubidus; nodular worm, Oesophagostomum species; threadworm, Strongyloides ransomi (adults only); somatic roundworm larvae (threadworm, S. ransomi [somatic larvae]); lungworms (Metastrongylus spp. [adults only]); lice (H. suis); and mites (Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis). In small animals (dogs and cats), it is used as a heartworm preventative (low dose) or to treat external parasites (mites) and intestinal parasites at higher doses. The benefit for heartworm prophylaxis in animals is the ability to kill young larvae, older larvae, and immature or young adults and adult filariae. Ivermectin is an effective microfilaricide after adulticide therapy. It has been recommended by the American Heartworm Society to treat heartworm- positive dogs for 2–3 months prior to adulticide therapy. This allows immature worms to reach full maturity that are more susceptible to melarsomine, as well as preventing new infection. Ivermectin can also reduce numbers of adult heartworms when administered long term at preventive doses. For optimal heartworm adulticide effect, it is often administered with oral doxycycline (10 mg/kg per day for 28 days). Treatment of Demodex infections is effective but requires higher doses than for any other indication.  See Instructions for Use section later for instructions to treat Demodex. Precautionary Information indications,\tlarge-\tanimal\tinjectable\tproducts\tare\toften\tadministered\tPO,\tIM,\tor\tSQ\tto small animals. Do not administer intravenously. Injections in pigs should be made in the neck only. Because some dogs may be sensitive to ivermectin, if a dog has not previously received ivermectin and high doses are needed (e.g., to treat Demodex infection), start with a low dose (50–100 mcg/kg) and then increase by increments of 50–100 mcg/kg/day on subsequent doses every day. During this increase, the dog should be observed for signs of CNS toxicity (ataxia, tremors, sedation). When the maintenance dose\tis\tachieved\t(300–600\tmcg/kg\tPO),\tit\tshould\tbe\tadministered\tonce\tdaily\tuntil 4\tweeks\tafter\tthe\tsecond\tconsecutive\tnegative\tmonthly\tskin\tscraping.\tWhen\tusing extralabel formulations to treat dogs, the aqueous formulations have better palatability than the propylene- based formulations. They can be mixed with flavorings to improve palatability.",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Toxicity may occur at high doses and in breeds in which ivermectin crosses the blood–brain barrier. Sensitive breeds include collies, Australian shepherds, Old English sheepdogs, longhaired whippets, and Shetland sheepdogs. Toxicity is neurotoxic and signs include hypersalivation, depression, ataxia, difficulty with vision, coma, and death. Sensitivity to ivermectin occurs in certain breeds because of a mutation in the multidrug resistance gene (ABCB1, formerly MDR1 gene) that\tcodes\tfor\tthe\tmembrane\tpump\tP-\tglycoprotein.\tThis\tmutation\taffects\tthe efflux pump in the blood–brain barrier. Therefore, ivermectin can accumulate in the brain of these susceptible animals. High doses in normal animals may also produce similar toxicosis. Most nonsusceptible dogs can tolerate doses of 100–400\tmcg/kg.\tBut\tsensitive\tbreeds\t(dogs\twith\tthe\tABCB1 mutation) may exhibit\ttoxicity\tat\tdoses\tof\t150–340\tmcg/kg. Retinopathy has also been observed in dogs administered high doses. In affected animals, a sudden onset of blindness, mydriasis, or both may occur, but dogs recover if the drug is discontinued.",

It is also approved for treatment and control of tick infestations caused by Amblyomma americanum (Lone Star tick), Dermacentor variabilis (American dog tick), Ixodes scapularis (black- legged tick), and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (brown dog tick) for 1 month in dogs. Because of this action, lotilaner can reduce the risk that these vectors may pose for disease transmission. For example, it may prevent infections caused by Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and Babesia canis. The approved label indication for lotilaner is treatment of fleas and ticks, but extralabel uses, using the approved label dose, have included treatment of generalized demodicosis caused by Demodex canis.

Regulatory Information Withdrawal times are not established for animals that produce food. For extralabel use withdrawal interval estimates, contact FARAD at www.FARAD.org. Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action Nitrofurantoin is an antibacterial drug that acts as a urinary antiseptic. It is a weak acid with low water solubility. Therapeutic concentrations are reached only in the urine. In the urine, it is reduced by bacterial flavoproteins, and the reactive metabolites bind to bacterial ribosomes and inhibit bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of DNA and RNA. The spectrum includes Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp., and Enterococcus spp., including strains that are resistant to other antimicrobial agents. Resistance among bacteria is unusual, although Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are intrinsically resistant and nitrofurantoin should not be used to treat urinary tract infections caused by these pathogens. Nitrofurantoin has time-dependent effects on E. coli, which may necessitate frequent administration for optimal clinical outcome. Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics have been studied in laboratory animals, dogs, and people. There is no pharmacokinetic data to guide the use in cats. In people, the concentrations in urine reach 200 mcg/mL, but plasma concentrations are almost undetectable. In dogs, a similar profile is observed. The macrocrystalline form is slowly absorbed and less likely to cause gastric upset. The microcrystalline form is rapidly absorbed in the intestine. In dogs, oral absorption is not affected by feeding. Oral absorption is rapid in dogs, with an elimination half-life of approximately 30 minutes and oral bioavailability Nitrofurantoin nye- troe- fyoo′ran- toyn Trade and other names: Macrodantin, Furalan, Furantoin, Furadantin, and generic brands",

In pigs, it is used for prevention of large roundworm (Ascaris suum) and prevention of the nodular worm Oesophagostomum spp. In dogs and cats, it is used for treatment of nematodes, including hookworms (Ancylostoma spp.) and roundworms (Toxocara cati, Toxocara canis, and Toxascaris leonina). There is some evidence that it is effective for control of some tapeworms, but ordinarily other drugs should be used for tapeworms (see Praziquantel). P Precautionary Information",

It is also effective for treatment of demodicosis caused by Demodex mites. Combination products contain moxidectin and pyrantel to prevent heartworms and intestinal roundworms.

The approved label indication for sarolaner is treatment of fleas and ticks, but extralabel uses, using the approved label dose, have included treatment of generalized demodicosis caused by Demodex canis. Dogs with Demodex infection treated with sarolaner once a month had significant mite reduction after treatment. Sarolaner can eliminate sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) and ear mites (Otodectes cynotis) in dogs. Precautionary Information",

In clinical field studies with the isooxazoline group of insecticides, adverse effects reported include vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and lethargy. Based on clinical experience, there is a concern about neurologic adverse effects, including seizures, from administration of isooxazolines in dogs. This has been reported with the use of sarolaner, and the manufacturer warns that it should be used cautiously in animals with a history of seizures.

Famciclovir has been effective in cats with experimentally induced or spontaneous herpetic disease. Optimum doses for cats: Early studies with oral administration of famciclovir at 62.5 mg per cat failed to produce high enough blood concentrations of penciclovir to be consistently effective. Most experts recommend dosages of 90 mg/kg PO q8–12h. The most consistent positive results have been from 90 mg/kg q8h. Most of these recommendations are derived from small observational studies. There has been conflicting results in shelter cats. In one study, a single dose of 125 or 500 mg to cats (16–52 or 92–227 mg/kg, respectively) at the time of shelter entry did not reduce shedding of FHV1 DNA or clinical disease scores compared with placebo. In another study, a dose of 30 or 90 mg/kg for 1 week did not reduce clinical signs of upper respiratory disease but reduced FHV1 shedding. In other studies, there were improvements in conjunctivitis, decreased conjunctival inflammation, decreased ocular discomfort, and decreased tearing.

It reduces blood pressure in some cats with kidney disease but is less effective in cats with spontaneous hypertension. Therefore, ACE inhibitors such as benazepril are not considered a primary treatment for hypertension in cats. Benazepril has been used in cats to treat proteinuria and hypertension in cats with chronic kidney disease. However, a survival benefit in cats with chronic kidney disease is not demonstrated. In studies in which it has been used in cats with renal insufficiency, it was associated with a small reduction in systemic hypertension, reduced glomerular filtration pressure, decreased glomerular hypertension, reduction in urine protein loss, and an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) but no overall benefits on survival. For cats with kidney disease and hypertension, other agents are preferred such as amlodipine or telmisartan. In dogs, it produces similar benefits to animals with kidney disease (decreased proteinuria, increased GFR, and lower blood pressure), but it does not increase survival.

        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects It has been generally safe and well- tolerated in dogs and cats, but these studies were in healthy animals. The most common side effect is hypotension. The half- life of fenoldopam is short; therefore, if hypotension is observed, decrease the infusion rate. Other adverse effects described for small animals include reflex tachycardia and mild hypokalemia. Rarely, it has caused facial twitching and hypersalivation in cats. In people, adverse effects can include increased intraocular pressure (risk in glaucoma), low potassium, and tachycardia.",

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses In small animals, furosemide is the drug of choice to treat conditions that cause edema, including pulmonary edema, liver disease, heart disease, and vascular disease. It is recommended in dogs with clinical signs of stage C heart disease, to be used initially, until the patient’s clinical signs have improved.

Furosemide promotes urine output by decreasing reabsorption of sodium but does not increase glomerular filtration rate. In horses, furosemide has been used to treat edema and syndromes associated with congestion. The most common use in horses is pretreatment prior to racing. Although it appears to produce faster racing times, the mechanism is unclear. It may decrease body weight via water loss and may decrease exercise- induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH). The efficacy to reduce EIPH has been controversial in horses, but there is reported evidence to support this effect. In cattle, furosemide also is used for treating conditions of edema (e.g., udder edema) and for treatment of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. In all animals, duration of effect is short, approximately 2–4 hours. Because of short duration, CRIs can produce greater efficacy in some animals. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Adverse effects are primarily related to diuretic effect (loss of fluid and electrolytes). In dogs, hyponatremia is more common than hypokalemia. Tolerance and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) occur with repeated administration, in which the diuretic effect is attenuated.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Recommendations for use of furosemide are based on extensive clinical use of furosemide in animals. The onset of effect after an injection is usually 5 minutes, with the peak at 30 minutes to 2 hours and a duration of approximately 2–4 hours. CRIs in dogs and horses can be more effective than intermittent bolus. Long- term repeated administration may attenuate the effects because of tolerance and activation of the RAAS.

Furosemide is poorly soluble in water but may be mixed with 5% dextrose, 0.9% saline, or lactated Ringer’s solution at a concentration of 10 mg/mL for IV administration. These solutions are stable for 8 hours. It is more soluble if the pH is greater than 8, but it readily precipitates when pH is less than 5.5. Compounded oral formulations in syrups and other flavorings are stable if kept at alkaline pH or in alcohol. However, lower pH results in instability of formulation.

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Nitroglycerin, like other nitrovasodilators, is used primarily in heart failure or pulmonary edema to reduce preload or decrease pulmonary hypertension. Nitrates relax smooth muscle in both arteries and veins, but they are often used clinically as preload reducers. When used as preload reducers, they decrease myocardial O 2 requirements (decrease workload of heart). Because of this effect, they have been commonly used to manage human patients with angina pectoris (chest pain caused by cardiovascular disease). Use in animals has been primarily derived from empirical use, recommendations from clinical experts, and experience extrapolated from human use. There are no well- controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document clinical effectiveness. In small animals, primarily dogs, it has been used in the hospital to treat animals with advanced stages of heart failure. In horses, nitroglycerin has been used to improve blood flow to the feet in the management of laminitis. However, in experiments, this treatment was not effective in horses and did not increase blood flow to the feet. Precautionary Information Indications and Clinical Uses Nitroprusside is used for acute management of pulmonary edema and other hypertensive conditions. It is administered only by IV infusion, and the dose is titrated carefully by monitoring systemic blood pressure. Titrate to maintain the arterial blood pressure to 70 mm Hg. Use in animals has been primarily derived from empirical use and experience in humans or the opinions from clinical cardiology experts. There are no well- controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document clinical effectiveness. The cost of nitroprusside has increased tremendously in recent years to as much as $750 per vial. Therefore, the high cost has discouraged use in animals. Nitroprusside (Sodium Nitroprusside) nye- troe- pruss′ide Trade and other names: Nitropress",

Efficacy is improved if the drug is used intermittently instead of continuously because intermittent use allows time for regeneration of sulfhydryl groups. Optimum intermittent use is to provide a nitrate- free interval of 8 hours or more during the day. Nitroglycerin has high presystemic metabolism, and oral availability is poor.

This use is more common in athletic horses on a racetrack than in other horses and is not related to the anticonvulsant property. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that oral absorption of phenytoin is highly variable in horses. Because of this variability, it is difficult to maintain consistent plasma concentrations.

If used in racing horses, consult with local regulatory authorities for restrictions. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Therapeutic drug monitoring can be performed; however, therapeutic concentrations have not been established for dogs and cats.

Drug Interactions Spironolactone is often used together with ACE inhibitors, such as enalapril.

Spironolactone is not recommended for routine use to delay the onset of heart failure in patients with valvular disease (stage B2). Spironolactone may also be used with angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to achieve a synergistic effect for treatment of heart failure in animals. The addition of spironolactone to traditional cardiac therapy can reduce the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in dogs with valvular disease. The proposed benefit of spironolactone treatment is via aldosterone antagonism and can be used to inhibit the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activation that occurs from diuretic administration (e.g., furosemide) or with some diseases that produce congestion. Despite treatment with ACE inhibitors, some animals may still exhibit aldosterone synthesis, which has been known as aldosterone breakthrough. Spironolactone may be effective to decrease the effects caused by aldosterone breakthrough. Spironolactone has also been used for managing hepatic cirrhosis because it inhibits ascites formation caused by excess aldosterone.

Studies to evaluate compounded insulin products for pets have shown that they are unreliable. Drug Interactions Administration of corticosteroids (prednisolone, dexamethasone, etc.) interfere with the action of insulin.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Insulin in its various forms is used to treat diabetes mellitus in dogs and cats. It is used to replace insulin that is deficient. In some cats (approximately 50%), some oral hypoglycemic drugs have been used to reduce use of insulin. However, diabetic dogs are more insulin dependent. Regular insulin is short acting and more useful for emergencies such as DKA and acute nonketotic syndromes. Intermediate-  and long- acting insulin preparations are used for maintenance and are available in a variety of forms (see previous section). Most of the animal sources of insulin (beef and pork) have been discontinued, and human- recombinant insulin",

        "notes": "formulations have been substituted without differences in efficacy. In cats, glargine insulin has shown better efficacy than other forms and has been associated with a better remission rate. Glargine also has been used to treat DKA in cats and shown to be effective when administered intramuscularly. In addition to diabetes mellitus, insulin is occasionally used to treat severe cases of hyperkalemia. Precautionary Information Instructions for Use Dietary management is essential for optimal glucose control. For proper management in cats, the mainstays of treatment are a low- carbohydrate, high- protein diet and twice- daily insulin. Many cats, if properly managed, may go into remission and not require lifelong insulin treatment. When treating dogs, feed dogs a high- fiber, low- fat diet. For all diabetic patients, the doses should be carefully adjusted in each patient depending on response. For cats with ketoacidosis, one dosing regimen has used 0.2 units/kg of regular insulin IM initially, then 0.1 units/kg IM every hour until the glucose level is less than 300,\tand\tthen\t0.25–0.4\tunits/kg\tq6h\tSQ. For maintenance therapy in cats, for most forms of insulin (including protamine zinc insulin and glargine insulin), twice- daily dosing usually is required.

Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Monitor blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine concentrations. When treating diabetes, it is desirable to maintain glucose concentrations between 100 and 300 mg/dL, with the nadir (lowest point) being 80–150 mg/dL. Serum fructosamine concentrations also can be monitored with the following guidance: less than 350 μmol/L, excellent control or remission; ≤450\tμmol/L, good control;\t450–500\tμmol/L, moderate control; and greater than 500, μmol/L poor control.

Stability and Storage Levothyroxine is inherently unstable and can be markedly affected by heat, light, and humidity. Store in a tightly sealed container, protected from light, and at room temperature. Thyroxine is only slightly soluble in water or ethanol. It is more soluble at pH of less than 2 or greater than 8. It has been unstable in some compounded formulations. However, it may be added to food products if administered immediately. Powder may be mixed with water and added to horse’s grain every day. When it was mixed with ethanol followed by mixing with a syrup, it was stable for 15 days at room temperature and 47 days refrigerated. However, other compounded preparations have been stable for only 15 days (refrigerated) or 11 days (room temperature). Therefore, use of compounded formulations should probably be limited to a storage time of 10–15 days.",

RCI\tClassification:\t4 Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is widely used in people, but infrequently used in animals. Naproxen and other NSAIDs produce analgesic and anti- inflammatory effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. The enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs is the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. The COX enzyme\texists\tin\ttwo\tisoforms:\tCOX-\t1\tand\tCOX-\t2.\tCOX-\t1\tis\tprimarily\tresponsible for synthesis of prostaglandins important for maintaining a healthy gastrointestinal (GI) tract, renal function, platelet function, and other normal functions. COX- 2 is induced and responsible for synthesizing prostaglandins that are important mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. However, there are overlapping functions of the mediators derived from these isoforms. Naproxen is a nonselective inhibitor of COX- 1  and  COX- 2.

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses In horses, domperidone is used to treat fescue toxicosis and periparturient agalactia in mares. Fescue toxicosis is caused by a fungus that produces a toxin that causes reproductive problems in horses. The action of domperidone to increase lactation is through the stimulation of prolactin. It increases follicular growth in seasonally anestrus mares and has been used (with altrenogest and estradiol) to induce lactation in barren mares. Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist and has been used to test for pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) in horses, but there are other approved treatments (e.g., pergolide). Domperidone has been used for short- term treatment to increase prolactin and aid milk production in nursing dogs and cats.

Most of this evidence is obtained from healthy research horses, and clinical effects to improve laminitis have not been established. Domperidone has been used to improve clinical signs in dogs infected with Leishmania spp. This effect may occur through prolactin production.

Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Bone marrow suppression is the most serious concern. Additional adverse effects in dogs include diarrhea, increased risk of secondary infections, and vomiting. Hepatotoxicosis after administration of azathioprine also has been reported. Toxicity may be related to the metabolites, particularly 6- MMP. The incidence of hepatotoxicity may occur in dogs after the first 2–4 weeks of treatment; therefore, this is the most critical time to monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin. Individuals who have higher sensitivity to the suppressing effects of bone marrow should have the dose reduced. There has been some association with development of pancreatitis when administered with corticosteroids, but this has not been confirmed. Susceptibility to the adverse effects, and prediction of therapeutic effects in people may be correlated with the levels of the metabolizing enzyme, TPMT. Some people are deficient and have a higher incidence of adverse effects. However, the TPMT levels in dogs are variable and have not been associated with either hepatotoxicity or myelotoxicity. Cats are deficient in TPMT and are particularly susceptible to toxicity.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Azathioprine is usually used in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., corticosteroids) to treat immune- mediated disease. Cats are very sensitive to the bone marrow–suppressing effects of azathioprine. Doses of 2.2 mg/kg to cats have produced toxicity, but some veterinarians have used low dosages of 0.3 mg/kg/ day. Alternatively, chlorambucil has been used instead of azathioprine in cats when immunosuppressive action is needed. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Monitor patient’s CBC periodically because some animals are sensitive to the effects of azathioprine and its metabolite, 6- MP. After 2 weeks of treatment, a CBC is essential. Because of risk of hepatotoxicity, monitor hepatic enzymes and bilirubin regularly.

A withdrawal time prior to allergen- specific allergy testing in dogs is not necessary. Drug Interactions Cimetidine, erythromycin, diltiazem, itraconazole, fluconazole, clarithromycin, or ketoconazole may increase cyclosporine concentrations when used concurrently.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Systemic uses (usually oral) for cyclosporine include IMHA, atopic dermatitis in dogs, and perianal fistulas. Other diseases have been treated with cyclosporine, such as sebaceous adenitis, idiopathic sterile nodular panniculitis, vesicular cutaneous lupus erythematosus, IMHA, immune- mediated thrombocytopenia, IBD, immune- mediated polyarthritis, myasthenia gravis, idiopathic chronic hepatitis, and aplastic anemia.

In dogs, there is strong evidence for effective treatment of atopic dermatitis, for which there is similar efficacy as prednisolone. Treatment response may be delayed for 2 weeks and for as long as 4 weeks in some dogs. During this induction time, it is acceptable to administer other medications (e.g., corticosteroids or oclacitinib) to control pruritus in dogs with atopic dermatitis.

In cats, cyclosporine has shown beneficial effects for treatment of EGC, IBD, atopic dermatitis (60% effective), oral stomatitis, and airway disease (feline asthma). Cyclosporine (Atopica for cats) is approved for control of feline allergic dermatitis. Higher doses are needed in cats compared with dogs because the oral absorption is more variable. In horses, it is effective as a localized treatment of anterior uveitis. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects The most common adverse effects in dogs and cats are GI problems (vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss). Vomiting is often observed only during C initial treatment and may be transient. Hypersalivation has been observed in cats. Cyclosporine may induce shedding of hair and stimulate new hair growth in dogs of\ta\tdifferent\tconsistency.\tNeurotoxicity\tfrom\thigh\tdoses\thas\tbeen\tseen\tin\tdogs, which can be seen as tremors. However, this is uncommon from recommended doses. Although kidney injury has been reported with older formulations, it has not been reported from use of current formulations of cyclosporine. Less commonly, cyclosporine can produce gingival proliferation (gingival hyperplasia) in animals, which is caused by a growth factor- mediated proliferation of gingival tissues. There are some reports that administration of azithromycin has been successful to resolve gingival hyperplasia. Occasionally, gingivitis and periodontitis may occur, which can be reversed after discontinuing the drug. There is no confirmed evidence that cyclosporine is a risk factor for neoplasia in dogs or cats. Calcineurin inhibitors can inhibit pancreatic beta cells and increase risk of diabetes in people. It may increase tissue insulin resistance and impair insulin production or secretion to increase glycemia. However, diabetes has not been reported in pets from clinical use of cyclosporine. Papillomas have been observed in dogs with chronic use. Unlike other immunosuppressive drugs, it does not cause myelosuppression. Cyclosporine may\tincrease\tthromboxane\tTXA 2 in platelets and increase platelet activation, but increased risk of thromboembolism has not been associated with cyclosporine treatment in dogs or cats. Aspirin can block this response. Effect on vaccination: At three times the clinical dose, it did not affect the immune response to killed rabies vaccine in dogs, but it failed to increase antibody titers from live parvovirus vaccine. Cats treated with cyclosporine, even at high doses, are capable of mounting a memory humoral immune response to booster vaccination (feline calicivirus, parvovirus, feline\tleukemia\tvirus\t[FeLV],\tfeline herpesvirus\ttype\t1\t[FHV-\t1],\tand\trabies)\tthat\tis\tadequate\tfor\tprotection.\tHowever, at high doses, a primary humoral response was not observed within 4 weeks of exposure\tto\ta\tnovel\tantigen\t(feline\timmunodeficiency\tvirus\t[FIV]).\tTherefore, naïve cats vaccinated before cyclosporine treatment should be able to mount an adequate primary immune response, and subsequent cyclosporine treatment should not affect immune response from booster vaccinations. Effect on infections in cats: Administration to cats at 7.5 mg/kg did not increase the severity of infection by Toxoplasma gondii in cats that were previously exposed (seropositive). However, administration of cyclosporine to cats that are naïve (seronegative) may increase the severity of T. gondii\tinfection.\tNaïve\tcats\tmay\thave a greater risk of developing clinical toxoplasmosis if they become infected while receiving\tcyclosporine\ttreatment.\tDo\tnot\tadminister\tto\tcats\tinfected\twith\tFeLV or\tFIV.\tIn\tcats\tinfected\twith\tFHV-\t1,\tadministration\tof\tcyclosporine\tactivated\tthe infection, but the disease was mild and self- limited in most cats.",

After animals have been treated with initial doses (see the dosing section) and are stable, doses may be adjusted by increasing the interval to once every other day or every third day rather than lowering the daily dose. Individual doses may be adjusted by monitoring blood concentrations, but monitoring is not necessary for routine use. Most of the experience is with the approved dose to treat atopic dermatitis and allergic dermatitis with doses of 5 mg/kg in dogs and 7 mg/ kg in cats. When used to treat animals for immune- mediated disease and organ transplantation, the doses are generally higher, often administered twice daily, and the blood concentrations maintained at a higher level.

To reduce the dose or increase blood concentrations, some veterinarians have administered ketoconazole or other enzyme- inhibiting compounds concurrently. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Although routine blood concentration monitoring is not necessary, it may be helpful to identify drug interactions, poor absorption, adverse reactions, or poor compliance. However, there has been no correlations established between blood concentrations in dogs and cats and clinical response. When monitoring, collect whole blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; purple top) tube for submission to laboratory. Suggested trough blood concentration range (whole blood assay) is 300–400 ng/ mL, although in some studies, levels as low as 200 ng/mL have been effective. Peak concentrations (collected at approximately 2 hours after oral administration of 5 mg/ kg) should be in the range of 600–1200 ng/mL.

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Bromide ordinarily is used in patients with seizure disorders that have been refractory to phenobarbital. Usually, patients are treated with both phenobarbital and bromide. However, some patients have been treated with B bromide as a single therapy for epilepsy. If bromide is added to phenobarbital therapy, it allows for a reduction in phenobarbital dose (reduce by 25% every 6 weeks). Despite clinical evidence of efficacy, the use of bromide for treating seizures in dogs has declined with the availability of other available agents, such as levetiracetam (Keppra). Bromide has not been as effective for treating cats with seizure disorders as in dogs, and the use in cats is discouraged. Cats have more adverse effects and are less well controlled; therefore, bromide is rarely recommended for a treatment in cats. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Common side effects include polyuria/polydipsia, polyphagia, ataxia, sedation, and GI upset. More serious adverse effects are related to high levels of bromide (bromism) and are more specific for the central nervous system (CNS). Signs of toxicosis are CNS depression, delirium, hyperexcitability, weakness, and ataxia. Hind limb stiffness and abnormal gait also may be signs of bromide toxicosis. If adverse effects occur, discontinuation of the medication usually results in resolution of the clinical signs in several days. Resolution may be faster (within hours) with aggressive saline diuresis. Nausea and pancreatitis have been reported in dogs, and there is evidence that a combination of bromide and phenobarbital in dogs may increase the risk of pancreatitis. However, there is no direct evidence that bromide alone produces pancreatic toxicity. There is no evidence available to indicate that bromide treatment affects thyroid function in dogs. Some dogs show paradoxical excitement with bromide treatment. In many cats, bronchitis resembling allergic airway disease has been observed. In cats, this may be characterized by coughing.",

        "notes": "Instructions for Use The use in dogs is based on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the United States and the approval for anticonvulsant use in Europe. For anticonvulsant use, it is recommended to start with 10 mg/kg and then increase dose to obtain the desired response. There have been no guidelines thus far for plasma/serum concentration monitoring; therefore, dose adjustment should be made on the basis of clinical response. The dose can be increased by 50% to 100% increments up to a maximum dosage of 30 mg/kg administered twice daily. When compared with primidone in dogs for treating epilepsy in a US field trial, imepitoin efficacy was lower than primidone, but it produced fewer adverse effects in dogs than primidone. In the field trials in Europe, the efficacy of imepitoin was compared with phenobarbital in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. Although there was lower overall efficacy for imepitoin compared with phenobarbital, some dogs were well- controlled with imepitoin treatment.

        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions Administer with caution to animals with liver disease. Phenobarbital may induce its own metabolism, which shortens the half- life. Therefore chronic administration may lower plasma concentrations, resulting in increases in the dose requirement. Pregnant animals may have an increase in seizure frequency, and an increase in dose may be necessary. Drug Interactions Phenobarbital is one of the most potent drugs for inducing hepatic microsomal metabolizing enzymes. Therefore, many drugs administered concurrently have lower (and perhaps subtherapeutic) concentrations because of more rapid clearance. Drugs affected may include theophylline, digoxin and other cardiovascular drugs, corticosteroids, anesthetics, and other drugs that may be substrates for the P- 450 enzymes. Phenobarbital shortens the half- life of levetiracetam (Keppra) in dogs, which may require higher doses or more frequent administration of levetiracetam. Administration of phenobarbital may lower total tetraiodothyronine (T 4) thyroid concentrations, but thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH)\tand\ttriiodothyronine\t(T 3) concentrations are unaffected.

Phenobarbital has been used in foals for treating seizures associated with perinatal encephalopathy. Phenobarbital also has been used as a sedative and for the treatment of behavior disorders. Phenobarbital has been effective for the treatment of sialadenosis in dogs caused by submandibular salivary gland enlargement. Precautionary Information",

Divalproex is composed of both valproic acid and sodium valproate. Equivalent oral doses of divalproex sodium and valproic acid deliver equivalent quantities of valproate ion. Contraindications and Precautions Do not use in pregnant animals. Birth defects have been reported in people. Drug Interactions Valproate may cause bleeding if used with drugs that inhibit platelets.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Valproate is used, usually in combination with phenobarbital, to treat refractory epilepsy in animals. Most of the experience has been in dogs, but the use is uncommon. The use of valproate in animals has declined because other anticonvulsants for treating refractory epilepsy have been identified such as gabapentin, pregabalin, zonisamide, and levetiracetam. The little clinical experience available is derived from small observational studies or anecdotal experience. Precautionary Information",

Drugs That Are Substrates for the P-Glycoprotein 1007 APPENDIX K Drugs That Are Substrates for the P- Glycoprotein Membrane Transporter Coded by ABCB1 (formerly known as MDR1) P-   glycoprotein is a membrane transporter responsible for transporting many drugs and other chemicals across membranes. A functional p- glycoprotein at the blood– brain barrier protects the brain from harmful effects of systemically administered drugs. P- glycoprotein may also be found at other important sites, such as the liver, placenta, kidney, and intestinal mucosa. Mutation of the gene that codes for p- glycoprotein  (ABCB1) that produces a function deletion exposes some dogs (e.g., some herding breeds) to toxic concentrations of some drugs. Alternatively, if a drug is administered that is a p- glycoprotein inhibitor (see Appendix J), it may decrease the effect of the membrane transporter and produce toxicity. Below are some of the p-   glycoprotein substrates that may be affected by a mutation or drug inhibition. •\t\tAcepromazine •\t\tActinomycin\tD •\t\tAldosterone •\t\tAmitriptyline •\t\tButorphanol •\t\tCortisol •\t\tCyclosporine •\t\tDexamethasone •\t\tDigoxin •\t\tDiltiazem •\t\tDocetaxel •\t\tDoramectin •\t\tDocetaxel •\t\tDoxorubicin •\t\tDoxycycline •\t\tEprinomectin •\t\tErythromycin •\t\tItraconazole •\t\tIvermectin •\t\tKetoconazole •\t\tLevofloxacin •\t\tLoperamide •\t\tMethylprednisolone •\t\tMilbemycin •\t\tMorphine •\t\tMoxidectin •\t\tOndansetron •\t\tPaclitaxel •\t\tPhenothiazines •\t\tQuinidine •\t\tSelamectin •\t\tTacrolimus •\t\tTerfenadine •\t\tTetracycline •\t\tVerapamil •\t\tVinblastine •\t\tVincristine References Mealey\tKL.

Performance Horse Drug Regulations and Restrictions 1011 APPENDIX O Performance Horse Drug Regulations and Restrictions Association of Racing Commissioners International, Inc., Uniform Classification Guidelines for Foreign Substances (Revised January 2020) The following definitions, regulations, and restrictions are adapted from the Racing Commissioners International (RCI) website (www.arci.com) and the Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI) Clean Sport Prohibited Substances List (www.feicleansport.org). The RCI Drug Classification Scheme is based on (1) pharmacology, (2) drug use patterns, and (3) the appropriateness of a drug for use in the racing horse. Classification Definitions Class 1 Stimulant and depressant drugs that have the highest potential to affect performance and  that  have  no  generally  accepted  medical  use  in  the  racing  horse.  Many  of  these agents  are  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  (DEA)  Schedule  II  substances.  These include the following drugs and their metabolites: opiates, opium derivatives, synthetic opioids  and  psychoactive  drugs,  amphetamines,  and  amphetamine-  like  drugs,  as  well as related drugs, including but not limited to, apomorphine, nikethamide, mazindol, pemoline,  and  pentylenetetrazol.  Although  not  used  as  therapeutic  agents,  all  DEA Schedule  1  agents  are  included  in  Class  1  because  they  are  potent  stimulant  or depressant substances with psychotropic and often habituative actions. This class also includes all erythropoietin-stimulating substances and their analogues. Class 2 Drugs that have a high potential to affect performance but less of a potential than drugs in Class 1. These drugs are (1) not generally accepted as therapeutic agents in racing horses, or (2) they are therapeutic agents that have a high potential for abuse. Drugs in  this  class  include  psychotropic  drugs,  certain  nervous  system  and  cardiovascular system  stimulants,  depressants,  and  neuromuscular  blocking  agents.  Injectable  local anesthetics are included in this class because of their high potential for abuse as nerve blocking agents. Class 3 Drugs that may or may not have generally accepted medical use in the racing horse but the pharmacology of which suggests less potential to affect performance than drugs  in  Class  2.  Drugs  in  this  class  include  bronchodilators,  anabolic  steroids and other drugs with primary effects on the autonomic nervous system, procaine, antihistamines with sedative properties, and the high- ceiling diuretics. Class 4 This  class  includes  therapeutic  medications  that  would  be  expected  to  have  less potential to affect performance than those in Class 3. Drugs in this class include less potent diuretics, corticosteroids, antihistamines and skeletal muscle relaxants without prominent  central  nervous  system  effects,  expectorants  and  mucolytics,  hemostatics, cardiac  glycosides  and  antiarrhythmics,  topical  anesthetics,  antidiarrheals,  and  mild analgesics.  This  class  also  includes  the  nonsteroidal  anti-  inflammatory  drugs  at concentrations greater than established limits. 1012    Performance Horse Drug Regulations and Restrictions Class 5 This class includes those therapeutic medications that have very localized actions only, such as antiulcer drugs and certain antiallergic drugs. The anticoagulant drugs are also included. Prohibited Substances in Racing Horses A.  The possession and/or use of a drug, substance, or medication, specified here, on the premises of a facility under the jurisdiction of the regulatory body for which a recognized  analytical  method  has  not  been  developed  to  detect  and  confirm  the administration of such substance; or the use of which may endanger the health and welfare of the horse or endanger the safety of the rider or driver; or the use of which may adversely affect the integrity of racing: 1.    Erythropoietin 2.    Darbepoetin 3.    Oxyglobin 4.    Hemopure B.      The possession and/or use of a drug, substance, or medication on the premises of a facility under the jurisdiction of the regulatory body that has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. C.    The  practice,  administration,  or  application  of  a  treatment,  procedure,  therapy, or method identified here, which is performed on the premises of a facility under jurisdiction  of  a  regulatory  body  and  which  may  endanger  the  health  and  welfare of the horse or endanger the safety of the rider or driver; or the use of which may adversely affect the integrity of racing. Equine Prohibited Drugs: Fédération Equestre Internationale Clean Sport Prohibited Substances Database (Revised January 2020) The FEI has published guidelines to assist veterinarians to make a distinction between the use of routine, legitimate medication and deliberate and calculated doping to affect a horse’s performance.

        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions Because zonisamide resembles sulfonamides in structure, use cautiously in animals that are sensitive to these drugs. (See Sulfonamide for full details on adverse effects.) Drug Interactions When administered concurrently with phenobarbital, the half- life of elimination is more rapid for zonisamide, which may necessitate higher doses. It is expected to potentiate other central nervous system depressants and anticonvulsants.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Zonisamide is used to treat refractory seizures in dogs when other drugs have not been effective. It has been effective in experimentally induced seizures in dogs and\tin\tapproximately\t50%\tof\tdogs\twith\trefractory\tepilepsy.\tIt\thas\tbeen\tused\tas an add- on with other anticonvulsant drugs such as phenobarbital and potassium bromide. When used as an add- on treatment, it may reduce the dose of other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital). It has been used in cats, as an add- on, or as a single treatment. Clinical efficacy has not been reported in cats, but at the doses Z listed, it suppressed electroencephalographic electrical activity in cats consistent with control of feline seizures. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Adverse effects reported are based on limited case reports. These are usually mild and transient. In dogs, it may cause sedation, lethargy, ataxia, and vomiting. Liver\tinjury\tis\tpossible,\tand\tdogs\tshould\tbe\tmonitored\tduring\ttreatment. Zonisamide can affect thyroid hormones in dogs, and thyroid monitoring should be performed in dogs on long-term treatment with zonisamide. Zonisamide is a sulfonamide drug, and dogs that are sensitive to sulfonamides may be at higher risk for reactions to zonisamide. In safety studies, beagles received 75\tmg/kg/day\tfor\t1\tyear\twith\tminimal\tside\teffects.\tIn\tcats,\tadverse\teffects include mild GI problems, sedation, and ataxia.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Most experience with zonisamide in animals has been preliminary work in dogs with refractory epilepsy. Although low doses may produce plasma concentrations within the therapeutic range reported for people, when administered with phenobarbital, drug concentrations may be lower because drug metabolism is increased. Zonisamide half- life was shorter in dogs receiving phenobarbital concurrently. These observations indicate that higher doses may be needed for combination therapy with phenobarbital compared with monotherapy. (Note that higher dose is listed later when used with phenobarbital.) With chronic treatment, some tolerance that reduces efficacy after 2–3 months may develop. Although zonisamide has been administered by the rectal route to animals, this is not recommended. The dose administered rectally was prepared by combining the contents of a capsule in water to a 100 mg/mL suspension. However, when delivered by the rectal route (20 or 30 mg/kg), it did not achieve plasma concentrations in the range that is considered therapeutic for dogs. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Effective plasma concentrations in animals have been suggested to be 10–40 mcg/mL. Concentrations above 20 mcg/mL in cats have produced adverse effects. Because of the potential for zonisamide to affect thyroid hormones in dogs, monitor tetraiodothyronine (T 4 ) levels periodically during treatment.

        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions Acetylcysteine may cause sensitization with prolonged topical administration. It may react with certain materials in nebulizing equipment. Avoid delivering via aerosol to the airways of cats because it might worsen clinical airway disease. Because acetylcysteine is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), it must be diluted in sterile water prior to injection. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to injection. Drug Interactions Acetylcysteine acts to donate sulfhydryl groups and may facilitate drug conjugation.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses As a donator of the sulfhydryl group, it is used as an antidote for intoxications (e.g., acetaminophen toxicosis in cats). It acts to replenish glutathione in animals that have been intoxicated with drugs that have reactive metabolites. When treating poisoning, it is important that acetylcysteine be administered as soon as possible for optimum effectiveness. Acetylcysteine also has been used to prevent contrast medium–induced nephropathy. Acetylcysteine has been used as a treatment of oxidative stress because it is a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals and hypochlorous acid. It also has been used to treat heavy metal toxicosis when administered with chelating agents. Acetylcysteine can reduce cerebral edema, but this has not produced any established clinical uses. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Allergic reactions have been reported in people, which resemble anaphylactic reactions when it is given IV. These reactions manifest as skin reactions, bronchospasm, tachycardia, and hypotension. Vomiting has been observed in cats, but this also may be caused by the toxicant (acetaminophen). When delivered via aerosol to the airways of cats, it increases airway resistance and could worsen airway disease in cats.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Available as an agent for decreasing viscosity of respiratory secretions, but most common use is as a treatment for intoxications, primarily for cats to treat acetaminophen toxicosis. When treating an intoxication, doses are listed here, but also consult a poison control center for specific guidelines. The doses used in cats (and listed in the dosing section) are extrapolated from dosages used in humans for treatment of intoxication. However, pharmacokinetics are different in cats (shorter half- life and faster clearance), and higher doses may be needed in severe cases.

When administered by injection, the solution is hyperosmolar and must be diluted first. Diluent for dilution can include 0.45% NaCl, 5% dextrose, or sterile water. An effervescent tablet of acetylcysteine (Cetylev) also is available and used in people to decrease hepatic injury caused by high doses of acetaminophen.

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses In both dogs and cats, amlodipine is effective for lowering systemic blood pressure. Therefore, it is used to treat systemic hypertension (high blood pressure). Amlodipine has been considered the drug of choice for many years by clinicians for treating hypertension in cats. Hypertension in cats has been defined as systolic blood pressure greater than 190 mm Hg and diastolic pressure greater than 120 mm Hg. By comparison, angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are less effective in cats, and they respond better to amlodipine than to ACE inhibitors. Amlodipine reduces blood pressure in hypertensive cats and can reduce proteinuria but may not improve survival in cats with hypertensive kidney disease. Beta blockers may be added to therapy for cats (e.g., atenolol) to control the heart rate in hypertensive and hyperthyroid cats, but beta blockers do not have a direct anti- hypertensive effect in cats. Although amlodipine has traditionally been considered the anti- hypertensive drug of choice for cats, recently, the angiotensin II blocker telmisartan has become a preferred agent because of proof of efficacy and available veterinary formulations (see Telmisartan for more information). A Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects The most common adverse effect is hypotension. In dogs and cats, gingival hyperplasia has been observed, which may be caused by an up- regulation of circulating androgens or inhibition of transglutaminase. Other mechanisms may be involved but are speculative. Gingival hyperplasia usually resolves after discontinuation of the medication and replacement with another drug (e.g., hydralazine or telmisartan). In both dogs and cats, amlodipine may activate the renin–angiotensin– aldosterone system (RAAS). When this occurs, ACE inhibitors may be somewhat effective in reducing activation of RAAS, but addition of this medication also may increase risk of hypotension and may decrease renal glomerular pressure. Less common adverse reactions include lethargy, decreased appetite, azotemia, mild hypokalemia, and weight loss. Reflex tachycardia can occur with excessive decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a calcium- channel blocker, and although the action is more specific for vascular smooth muscle, it may depress the heart in some patients. Therefore, use carefully in patients with heart block or compromised cardiac contractility.

        "notes": "Instructions for Use In cats, efficacy has been established at 0.625 mg/cat once daily. If cats are large size (greater than 4.5 kg) or refractory, increase dose to 1.25 mg/cat q24h PO. In some cats, addition of a beta blocker to slow heart rate may be indicated. The goal of treatment is to decrease systolic pressure to less than 150/90 (systolic/diastolic). See the Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests section. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Monitoring the patient’s blood pressure is essential to proper treatment. Cats with high blood pressures of systolic 160–190 mm Hg and diastolic 100–120 mm Hg should be considered at risk of clinical effects from hypertension. When using amlodipine, the target blood pressure should be less than 160 mm Hg.

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Aspirin is used as an analgesic, anti- inflammatory, and antiplatelet drug. Aspirin has a long history of use for treating pain and inflammation, especially associated with osteoarthritis. Although it may be effective in animals, other agents specifically approved for animals are much more commonly used nowadays for osteoarthritis and other painful conditions. At low doses, aspirin is a more specific COX- 1 selective inhibitor and antiplatelet drug than other NSAIDs. Therefore, low doses have been used in animals to inhibit platelets and prevent thromboemboli formation. Inhibition of platelets is justified for some diseases because as platelets become hyper- reactive, they can release serotonin and other mediators that may exacerbate vascular diseases and produce blood clots. Although these low doses of aspirin are often used for antiplatelet therapy, aspirin does not provide complete inhibition of platelet stimulation. Low doses (e.g., 1–5 mg/kg) produce inconsistent platelet inhibition in dogs and cats. Some animals are refractory (aspirin resistance). Addition of other antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel (Plavix) provides more effective inhibition. Aspirin has been used to prevent complications from heartworm disease (thromboemboli). However, there is no convincing evidence that there is a clinical benefit from this treatment. Some evidence indicates that aspirin may be contraindicated in heartworm disease. In cats, exposure of feline platelets in vitro to aspirin can have an inhibitory effect. Platelets collected from cats ex vivo after treatment with aspirin (5 mg/kg) had decreased TXA2 production, but platelet aggregation was not affected. Although aspirin has been available for many years, it is not registered by the Food\tand\tDrug\tAdministration\t(FDA)\tfor\tuse\tin\tany\tspecies.\tThere\tare\tno\tpublished controlled\tstudies\tto\tdocument\tefficacy.\tUse\tof\taspirin\tin\tanimals\tis\tprimarily\tbased\ton empiricism rather than on published data.

        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Narrow therapeutic index. High doses frequently cause vomiting. Other GI effects can include ulceration and bleeding. Aspirin may inhibit platelets and increases risk of bleeding.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Analgesic and anti- inflammatory doses have primarily been derived from empiricism. Antiplatelet doses are lower because of potent and prolonged effect of aspirin on platelets. The dosing section lists “antiplatelet” doses for aspirin in dogs and cats, but the efficacy of these doses has not been verified through clinical studies. Results from research animals have produced varied results. In some studies, 5–10 mg/kg was considered a consistent antiplatelet dose for dogs; in other studies, 1 mg/kg inhibited platelets in only one third of dogs; and in research dogs, doses as low as 0.5 mg/kg q12h impaired platelet aggregation. Aspirin is only available in oral form. Because it is a weak acid, it is ordinarily absorbed best in the acidic environment of the upper GI tract; however, considerable absorption also takes place farther in the intestine. In dogs, enteric- coated aspirin reduces gastric irritation, but absorption from this form is erratic and often incomplete. Buffering does not affect absorption but may protect the stomach from injury when high doses are administered. Buffering has less of a beneficial effect when low doses are administered and is not expected to protect the stomach from the more serious effects of GI ulceration, bleeding, and perforations.

Clinical studies in dogs showed over 90% efficacy in reduction of mammary gland and improvement in behavior within 10 days. This action is through the inhibition of prolactin, which reduces the signs of pseudopregnancy in dogs and inhibits the development of the mammary gland and lactation. It should be administered once daily (see the dosing section) for 4–6 days initially but can be repeated to fully resolve the problem. In dogs, it is also used for treatment of primary and secondary anestrus. The dosage used for anestrus is 5 mcg/kg PO once daily until 2 days after the onset of proestrus. One study also used a lower dosage of 0.6 mcg/kg PO once daily for treatment of anestrus. In people, cabergoline is used to treat diseases associated with high levels of prolactin, prolactinoma (prolactin- secreting adenomas), or idiopathic hyperprolactinemia. It is as effective and longer acting than bromocriptine. There are also fewer adverse effects in women compared with treatment with bromocriptine.

The only approved dose for cats is 4 mg/kg as a one- time injection for surgical pain. However, for long- term use, pharmacokinetic extrapolations suggest a long- term dosage of 0.5 mg/kg q24h PO. Long- term safety at this dosage has not been established. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests After administration has begun, one should monitor hepatic enzymes for evidence of drug- induced hepatic toxicity approximately 7–14 days after treatment has started. If liver enzymes are elevated, discontinue the medication and contact the drug manufacturer.

One of the most frequent uses has been for treatment of immune- mediated skin diseases of cats, for which it has been used to treat cats with pemphigus and eosinophilic granuloma complex (EGC). It is often administered concurrently with corticosteroids. It also has been used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in cats and dogs and has been effective for chronic enteropathy characterized by protein losing enteropathy in dogs. Chlorambucil also has been used as an anticancer agent in some protocols. It also has been used in metronomic dosing protocols.

In one study at approved doses, it did not have any adverse effects on equine cardiac or skeletal muscle. In other studies, it had negative effects on aerobic athletic performance, faster time to fatigue, decreased cardiac function, and decreased oxygen consumption.

Use in young horses: The manufacturer states that the safety of clodronate in horses younger than 4 years of age has not been evaluated. They also state that the effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity, which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. It is recommended not to administer bisphosphonates such as clodronate in young performance horses because the change in bone metabolism may predispose young horses to fracture, but one study that examined clodronate and tiludronate in young horses concluded that tiludronate and clodronate did not appear to significantly impact bone tissue on a structural or cellular level using standard dose and administration schedules in young horses.

In dogs, at a dose of either 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg, decreased ADP- induced platelet aggregation occurs for 3 days after discontinuation of drug administration in some dogs and longer than 7 days in others. At 2 mg/kg PO q24h, clopidogrel significantly suppressed platelet activity in horses, which persisted for 6 days after the last dose. However, not all horses respond, and effects may not be sustained for 24 hours. This may be caused by rapid elimination of the active metabolite in some horses. A similar drug is ticlopidine (Ticlid), which should not be used in cats because it produces adverse reactions.

Vitamin B 12 is used to manage vitamin B deficiencies associated with cobalt deficiency, inadequate intake, or intestinal malabsorption.

Cobalamin deficiency may occur with pancreatic\tdisease\tbecause\tit\trequires\tan\tintrinsic\tfactor\t(IF)\tfor\tabsorption,\tand\tIF\tis produced by the pancreas. Deficiencies produce metabolic consequences, including anorexia, weight loss, lethargy, central and peripheral neuropathy, villous atrophy, and malabsorption of various vitamins and minerals.

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Cyclophosphamide is used primarily as an adjunct for cancer chemotherapy and as immunosuppressive therapy. Cyclophosphamide is the most potent of the nitrogen mustards. It is used in chemotherapy protocols for a variety of tumors, carcinomas, sarcomas, feline lymphoproliferative diseases, mast cell tumor, mammary carcinoma, and especially lymphoproliferative tumors (lymphoma). Cancer protocols such as cyclophosphamide, Oncovin, and prednisone (COP) and cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, Oncovin, and prednisone (CHOP) incorporate cyclophosphamide as one of the agents. Cyclophosphamide is also used as continuous treatment for some cancers, also known as metronomic dosing. The advantage of metronomic dosing is decreased adverse effects (lower dose), and other benefits such as decreased angiogenesis in tumors (decreased proliferation), decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),\tand\tdecreased\tcirculating\tT-\tregulatory\tcells\t(T-\treg).\tHowever,\tthe\tbenefits of metronomic dosing in small animals has not been established, except for some limited experience. See the dosing section for metronomic protocol. Cyclophosphamide has been used as an immunosuppressive agent for some forms of immune- mediated disease. Although it has been used for various immune- mediated disorders in animals (immune- mediated hemolytic anemia [IMHA], pemphigus, systemic lupus erythematosus), efficacy has not been reported in controlled studies for\tthese\tdiseases.\tFor\ttreatment\tof\tIMHA\t(50\tmg/m 2 ), there was no benefit over prednisolone alone. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Cyclophosphamide is toxic to the bone marrow in a dose- dependent manner. After a single large bolus dose, the nadir of toxicity occurs in 7–10 days, but the effect is reversible because stem cells are usually unaffected. Recovery usually occurs in 21–28 days. Vomiting and diarrhea may occur in some patients. Sterile, hemorrhagic cystitis is a serious and limiting complication to therapy in dogs. It is caused by the toxic effects of metabolites on the bladder epithelium (especially acrolein) that are concentrated and excreted in the urine. Various attempts are used to decrease the injury to the bladder epithelium. Corticosteroids are usually administered with cyclophosphamide to induce polyuria and decrease inflammation of the bladder. The drug mesna (Mesnex, mercaptoethane sulfonate) provides free active thiol groups to bind metabolites of cyclophosphamide in the urine. Furosemide\t(2.2\tmg/kg)\tadministered\tat\tthe\tsame\ttime\tas\tthe\tcyclophosphamide dose may decrease risk of sterile hemorrhagic cystitis. Cats are less susceptible to developing cystitis than dogs. Cyclophosphamide may cause hair loss when used in some chemotherapeutic protocols.

Dopamine infusions will increase both blood pressure and cardiac output. These effects are caused by stimulating cardiac contractility and heart rate by acting as an agonist for beta 1 - adrenergic receptors. In addition, dopamine increases the release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals (dopamine is a precursor for norepinephrine). It produces a greater chronotropic effect than dobutamine. It has been proposed that dopamine dilates renal arterioles, increases renal blood flow, and increases the glomerular filtration rate. This effect is proposed to\toccur\tvia\tactivation\tof\trenal\tdopamine-\t1\t(DA 1 ) receptors. Because of this proposed\teffect,\tin\tthe\tpast\tit\thas\tbeen\tused\tfor\tacute\trenal\tfailure.\tHowever, recent evaluation has raised doubts about the clinical effectiveness of dopamine for treatment of acute renal failure. Cats do not have as many DA 1 receptors as other animals; therefore it has not been effective in cats to produce diuresis.

Famotidine increases stomach pH to help heal and prevent gastric and duodenal ulcers. Contraindications and Precautions Intravenous solutions contain benzyl alcohol. IV injections to small animals, especially cats, should be done slowly. Drug Interactions 2 - receptor blockers block secretion of stomach acid. Therefore, they interfere with oral absorption of drugs dependent on acidity, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and iron supplements. Unlike cimetidine, famotidine is not associated with inhibition of microsomal P450 enzymes.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses 2 - receptor blockers, is used to treat ulcers and gastritis in a variety of animals. Although it is often used for animals with vomiting, there are no efficacy data to indicate that it is effective as an antiemetic. There are no efficacy data to support its use for preventing nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID)–induced bleeding and ulcers. Famotidine has been used by veterinarians as a preferred H 2 blocker, but there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate superiority over other drugs in this class. Some studies have demonstrated efficacy at 1 mg/kg in dogs, while other studies have not demonstrated differences between famotidine and a placebo in dogs for increasing stomach pH. The target goal for stomach pH is greater than 3 for 75% of the dose interval or a pH greater than 4 for 67% of the dose interval. With oral doses, famotidine often does not meet these targets. Most evidence supports a lack of efficacy in dogs at a dosage of 1 mg/kg administered q12h, but it is more effective if administered as a constant- rate infusion (CRI) (1 mg/kg IV loading dose followed by 8- mg/kg/ day infusion). In dogs, it may have short-term effects on acid suppression, but it had a diminished effect if administered for more than 12 days. It had less effect to maintain the stomach pH above 3 on day 1 of dosing compared with day 12. Therefore, if used, famotidine may be better for short- term use than long- term administration. The use in large animals has received little attention. Omeprazole is preferred in horses for stomach acid suppression. In cattle, the half- life of famotidine is short and requires frequent administration (e.g., q6h) for effectiveness. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, and others are more effective for consistently suppressing stomach acid secretion and are preferred over histamine H 2 antagonists for dogs, horses, and cats. Precautionary Information",

In people, central nervous system (CNS) signs may occur with high doses. The IV solution contains benzyl alcohol, aspartic acid, and mannitol. Give IV injections slowly to cats (over 5 minutes) because rapid IV injections may cause hemolysis.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Administer with food for best absorption. Clinical studies for famotidine have not been performed; therefore, optimal doses for ulcer prevention and healing are not known. Dose recommendations are extrapolated from human use, studies in experimental animals,  or from anecdotal experience. Experimental studies in dogs 354    Febantel have shown that doses of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg may inhibit stomach acid secretion, but most other studies have shown that higher doses of 1.0 mg/kg are needed to suppress stomach acid.

Administration to cows with mastitis showed that elimination may be prolonged more than healthy cows, thus increasing the risk of violative residues, even when withdrawal times are followed. Do not use for treating heat stroke in animals. Drug Interactions Ulcerogenic effects are potentiated when administered with corticosteroids. Coadministration with phenylbutazone will increase the risk of hypoproteinemia and gastric ulcers in horses. Flunixin, like other NSAIDs, may interfere with the action of diuretics such as furosemide and ACE inhibitors. Coadministration with enrofloxacin in dogs increased flunixin plasma concentrations because of reduced clearance.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Flunixin is used primarily for short- term treatment of moderate pain and inflammation. It has been used to treat abdominal pain in horses and to decrease signs of sepsis in horses. In horses, as an adjunctive treatment for sepsis, it is often used at a low dose of 0.25 mg/kg. The dose of 0.25 mg/kg is not an “antiendotoxin” dose, as is popularly characterized, because it does not directly inhibit endotoxin. But at this low dose, it may inhibit prostaglandins responsible for hemodynamic effects during sepsis in horses. It is approved in the United States for treatment of pyrexia in cattle associated with BRD and to decrease clinical signs associated with coliform mastitis, as well as control of inflammation associated with endotoxemia. Flunixin has been used as a single dose for treatment of diarrhea in dairy calves. The transdermal formulation is the only NSAID approved in the United States for treatment of pain in cattle. Flunixin at 2.2 mg/kg IV in cows with endotoxin mastitis did not affect milk production, but it decreased fever and improved rumen motility. Flunixin has been used as an adjunctive treatment, with antibiotics, for treatment of BRD in which it reduces inflammatory lung reactions and reduces BRD- associated pyrexia. Resflor Gold contains both florfenicol and flunixin in the same formulation. Hexasol contains oxytetracycline and flunixin in the same formulation. In pigs, flunixin is used for pyrexia associated with SRD. In dogs and cats, flunixin has been used occasionally, but treatment is usually confined to one or two treatments because of risk of GI toxicity (ulcers and perforation). Generally, other NSAIDs that have a better safety profile are used in dogs and cats. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Most severe adverse effects are related to the GI system. Flunixin causes gastritis and GI ulceration with high doses or prolonged use. Reduced renal perfusion has also been documented. In horses, flunixin administration may affect recovery after ischemic injury to the intestine. In horses, if given IM, it can result in myositis and abscess at the injection site. It can also cause irritation and injection- site lesions\tif\tinjected\tSQ\tor\tIM\tin\tcattle.\tIf\tused\tin\tdogs,\ttreatment\tshould\tnot\tgo beyond 4 consecutive days.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Flunixin use in food producing animals must follow the label instructions for the condition treated. Treatment interval in all animals is limited to once daily to avoid adverse effects on GI tract and kidney. It is not approved for small animals in the United States but has been approved for use in small animals in Europe for short- term use. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Monitor treated animals for signs of GI bleeding and ulcers during treatment.

In trials comparing fluoxetine with clomipramine for treating urine marking in cats, both drugs were equally effective for long- term use. However, the urine marking returned after discontinuation of the drug. In both dogs and cats, SSRIs have been used for pain syndromes, such as neuropathic pain, but there are no studies of efficacy published to confirm efficacy for this indication.

During clinical trials in dogs, adverse reactions included vomiting, decreased appetite, lethargy, depression, trembling, and shaking in some dogs; the most common were lethargy and decreased appetite. In rare cases, it may cause seizures. Adverse effects are more common at doses above 8–10 mg/kg, but occasionally, some of these signs may be seen at lower doses. In dogs, at high doses of 10–20 mg/kg, it caused tremors, anorexia, aggressive behavior, nystagmus, emesis, and ataxia. Seizures can occur at doses above 25 mg/kg. In cats, nervousness or increased anxiousness has been observed. In cats, 5 mg/kg produced tremors, and 3 mg/kg produced anorexia and vomiting. However, in trials used for treating urine spraying, few adverse effects were reported, and cats have tolerated doses up to 50 mg/kg.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Always use in conjunction with a comprehensive behavior modification protocol. Clinical efficacy of fluoxetine for separation anxiety in dogs has been established from clinical studies. Because of a long half- life, accumulation in plasma may take several days to weeks. There may be a delay in the onset of action of 2 weeks. Do not apply transdermally; absorption is low, and it may cause skin irritation. In some animals, paroxetine (Paxil) is preferred, which is a human formulation available in tablets and has been used for smaller- size animals. Sudden discontinuation of serotonin reuptake inhibitors can produce other behavior problems, such as anxiety, signs of agitation and nervousness. If treatment is discontinued, gradually withdraw the medication. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Use in animals has been relatively safe, and one should only monitor behavior changes.

When administered with propofol to horses, it helped to prevent adverse anesthetic events that occur when propofol is administered as a sole agent. Guaifenesin is also administered orally in animals as an expectorant. It has been administered orally to horses (3.5 mg/kg) to clear mucus from airways. Supporting data for an expectorant effect are lacking, but it may increase the volume and reduce the viscosity of secretions in the trachea and bronchi. It may also facilitate removal of secretions.

In horses, when used alone for anesthetic induction, it may cause excitement, myotonus, and paddling. Therefore, it is often used with other agents in horses. A vagal effect (e.g., stimulation of secretions) may occur when the drug is used as an expectorant.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use For anesthetic purposes, it is used with other agents. For IV infusion, 5% guaifenesin is prepared from powder (50 g/L) dissolved in sterile water. It dissolves more readily if the water is warm. Infusion of 110 mg/kg can produce transient recumbency. It can be administered with a variety of other anesthetic agents for the benefit of producing a smoother induction in horses. One such combination is Equine  “Triple- Drip” listed in the dosing section. It also has been administered with propofol to horses (3 mg/kg of propofol and 90 mg/kg of guaifenesin infused over 3 minutes).

Drug Interactions Hydroxyethyl starch is compatible with most fluid solutions.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses The use of hydroxyethyl starch for resuscitation in veterinary patients remains controversial. If used by emergency or critical care clinicians, hydroxyethyl starch is used primarily to treat acute hypovolemia and shock. It is administered intravenously in acute situations in which rapid restoration of circulating volume is needed. Hydroxyethyl starch solutions have a duration of effective volume expansion of 12–48\thours. The formulations available are 6%, which is isotonic, and 10%, which is hypertonic. Because of more adverse reactions with the higher concentration 10% solution, they are not used commonly. Although hydroxyethyl starch is used by many clinical experts in critically ill hypovolemic and septic patients, other experts have recommended against its use because of its expense, lack of superiority over other treatments, and potential harm. These experts argue that because there is evidence of harm in people, this should warrant caution in animals also (see Adverse Reactions and Side Effects for more details). Precautionary Information",

These products are no longer recommended in critically ill human patients with sepsis, burns, renal impairment, or coagulopathies. The human Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against the use of hydroxyethyl starch. The high- molecular- weight hetastarch may alter coagulation and alter viscoelastic measurements and fibrinolysis. Hydroxyethyl starch solutions may affect platelet function and produce coagulation abnormalities at clinically relevant doses for up to 24 hours. Tetrastarch solutions may have less tendency to cause coagulopathies than hetastarch; therefore the current recommendation is to use tetrastarch solutions of 6% and reduced molecular weight (130 kDa) to reduce risk of adverse effects. High- molecular- weight products with molecular weights more than 200 kDa are associated with higher risk of kidney injury. The proposed mechanism for kidney injury is through uptake by proximal epithelial tubular cells as lysosomes leading to injury to proximal tubular cells. The use in veterinary patients has become controversial. There have been conflicting results from studies, with some demonstrating evidence of kidney injury in dogs and conflicting results showing no kidney injury. It is possible that this difference is attributed to differences in molecular weight of the products with the lower molecular weight forms less likely to cause injury.",

Butylscopolamine, like other antimuscarinic drugs (e.g., atropine), blocks cholinergic receptors and produces a parasympatholytic effect. It affects receptors throughout the body, but it is used more commonly for its GI effects. It effectively inhibits secretions and motility of the GI tract by blocking parasympathetic receptors. It has a short half- life (15–25 minutes) and short duration of action.",
        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions Caution is advised when using the OTC formulation designed for people because the tablet size is much larger than the safe dose for dogs. Therefore warn pet owners about administration to dogs without consulting a veterinarian first. Dosing rates for people are not appropriate for dogs. Do not administer to animals prone to GI ulcers. Do not administer with other ulcerogenic drugs, such as corticosteroids. Drug Interactions Do not administer with other NSAIDs or with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids have been shown to exacerbate the GI adverse effects. Some NSAIDs may interfere with the action of diuretic drugs and angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors.",

RCI\tClassification:\t3 Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action Niacinamide is a derivative of vitamin B and sometimes used for immune- mediated diseases. It is not a direct- acting immunosuppressant. The use is primarily to treat skin diseases, such as discoid lupus erythematosus and pemphigus erythematosus in dogs. The mechanism of action is not entirely known. Niacinamide may have some anti- inflammatory action such as suppression of inflammatory cells. Niacin and niacinamide are also used to treat vitamin B 3 deficiency. Do not confuse niacin with niacinamide. Niacin is converted to the active form niacinamide by intestinal bacteria. Niacin is used in people as a lipid- regulating compound used to lower circulating blood triglycerides and reduce low- density lipoproteins.

        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Adverse effects are caused by the cholinergic action resulting from inhibition of cholinesterase. These effects are manifest in the GI tract as diarrhea, increased secretions, and smooth muscle contractions. Other adverse effects can include miosis, bradycardia, muscle twitching or weakness, and constriction of bronchi and ureters. Adverse effects can be treated with anticholinergic drugs such as atropine. N Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Side effects are not common but have included vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and diarrhea. In people, when niacin is administered to treat dyslipidemias, side effects are common, including flushing of skin. The flushing effect of niacin is thought to occur through skin prostaglandin induction and activation of prostaglandin- associated receptors.

        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions One of the human formulations (Zegerid) is a packet to be mixed with water for oral administration. This formulation contains xylitol, which can be toxic to dogs if administered at high doses or with other medications that contain xylitol. Drug Interactions Although omeprazole has not been associated with drug interactions in animals, PPIs may inhibit some drug- metabolizing enzymes (CYP450 enzymes). In people, metabolism of clopidogrel to the active metabolite can be inhibited by omeprazole, but this inhibition was not demonstrated in studies in dogs and has not been studied in horses or cats. Metabolism of other drugs may be inhibited by omeprazole, but this has not been studied in domestic animals. Because all PPIs decrease stomach acid, do not administer with drugs that depend on stomach acid for absorption (e.g., ketoconazole and itraconazole). In people, there may be an increased risk of intestinal injury when PPIs are administered\twith\tNSAIDs,\tbut\tthis\thas\tnot\tbeen\tstudied\tin\tanimals. Omeprazole may be administered with sucralfate, which may increase efficacy for some gastric and esophageal diseases. However, in horses and perhaps other animals, the combination is more effective when sucralfate is administered 60–90 minutes after omeprazole.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Omeprazole, like other PPIs, is used for treatment and prevention of GI ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux. It has been used in dogs, cats, and exotic species, but most efficacy data for animals have been produced in horses, in which it has been shown that omeprazole is effective for treating and preventing gastric ulcers. In foals, 4 mg/kg q24h suppresses acid secretion for 22 hours. By comparison, ranitidine suppresses acid up to 8 hours at a dose of 6.6 mg/kg. In studies performed in horses, omeprazole was more effective than ranitidine for treating gastric ulcers. For treatment of ulcers in horses, the approved label treatment in the United States is 4 mg/kg PO once per day. However, there is evidence to indicate that a dosage of 1 mg/kg per day is equally effective. For more effective healing of gastric ulcers, consider twice- daily administration instead of once daily. The equine formulations in the United States (GastroGard and UlcerGard) are buffered formulations. An enteric- coated formulation is available for horses in some countries (Gastrozol). Plasma omeprazole concentrations after single doses are significantly higher with GastroGard than Gastrozol when each is administered at the labeled dose. These formulations, when combined with environmental changes, promote healing of gastric ulcers in horses. The response to treatment will depend on the type of equine gastric ulcer syndrome being treated. Horses with equine squamous gastric disease (ESGD) respond much more favorably to acid suppression with omeprazole than those with equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD), reflecting the differences in pathogenesis and response between these two distinct forms of equine gastric disease. There was a 25% response rate for EGGD and a 78% response rate for ESGD at a dosage of 4 mg/kg once daily for 28–35 days. Some experts recommend oral omeprazole (4 mg/kg q24h) in combination with oral sucralfate 12 mg/kg q12h) for better healing rates for treating EGGD. In dogs, 1 mg/kg q24h PO is as effective as pantoprazole (1 mg/kg) and famotidine (0.5 mg/kg q12h) for maintaining stomach pH greater than 3–4, which is the recommended pH range for ulcer healing. Twice- daily administration of omeprazole may be more effective than once daily. Repeated doses may be necessary (two to five doses) for complete inhibition of acid secretion. In dogs and cats, PPIs may be more effective than other drugs (e.g., histamine H 2 blockers) because of the long duration of effect. In cats, the equine formulation and fractionated tablets were equally effective for suppressing acid secretion and were superior to an H 2 blocker (famotidine). In O a similar study performed in dogs, omeprazole tablets or equine paste administered once daily provided superior acid suppression compared to famotidine twice daily. Omeprazole, like other PPIs, may be effective for preventing nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory\tdrug\t(NSAID)–induced\tulcers.\tOmeprazole\thas\talso\tbeen\tused\tin combination with other drugs (antibiotics) for treatment of Helicobacter infections in animals. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects The only reported adverse effect in dogs has been diarrhea in some cases. Otherwise, adverse effects have not been reported in animals. In people, there is concern about hypergastrinemia with chronic use, but this has not been a concern in animals. Horses have tolerated 20 mg/kg q24h for 91 days and 40 mg/kg q24h PO for 21 days. Dogs and cats also have tolerated the regimens listed in the dosing section. Overgrowth of Clostridium bacteria has been a concern from chronic use because of chronic gastric acid suppression, but the clinical importance of this observation in animals has not been established. In people, long- term use of PPIs has been associated with a modest risk of hip fractures because of decreased oral absorption of calcium and increased bone resorption by osteoclasts. This problem has not been reported in animals. In cats with chronic kidney disease, omeprazole was well tolerated, but treatment increased sodium concentrations. The cause or the significance of this observation is undetermined. Although effects on bone have been a concern in people, when administered for 60 days to cats (1 mg/kg q12h), there was no change in cobalamin, calcium, magnesium, or bone mineral content or density.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Omeprazole is the most common drug of this class used in animals. Other PPIs include pantoprazole (Protonix), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and the S- isomer of omeprazole, esomeprazole. Less experience with these other products is reported for veterinary medicine. Pantoprazole and rabeprazole have the advantage in that they are available as tablets that can be crushed. The equine formulations available include GastroGard and UlcerGard, which are buffered formulations to enhance oral absorption. Gastrozol is an enteric- coated formulation for horses available in Australia (see Indications and Clinical Use for comparison). Rectal administration has been studied in horses but has produced low and inconsistent response. Treatment response varies in horses depending on the type of gastric ulcer syndrome treated. Patients with ESGD respond much more favorably to omeprazole than those with EGGD. In horses, it is recommended that at least 4 weeks of treatment is needed for full healing in addition to other changes in diet and feeding. To achieve the full extent of acid suppression, it is recommended to administer omeprazole to horses 60–90 minutes before feeding so that the peak concentration occurs at the time that the proton pumps in the stomach are maximally activated. This recommendation may also apply to treating other animals, such as dogs and cats. Twice- daily administration produces more consistent acid suppression to maintain the stomach pH above 3–4 than once- daily administration. Because there are no small animal formulations available, the human forms have been administered to dogs and cats, and the equine formulation has been diluted in oil to 10 and 40 mg/mL (see the Formulations section) for administration to small animals. Studies with the equine formulation compounded in oil have shown that the equine formulation administered orally to dogs can be efficacious. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Omeprazole\tand\tPPIs\tare\tgenerally\tconsidered\tsafe.\tNo\troutine\ttests\tfor\tmonitoring adverse effects are recommended. If gastrin concentrations are measured, a 7- day withdrawal from omeprazole treatment should be used; otherwise, there is a significant increase in serum gastrin concentrations from omeprazole treatment.

In surgery, it may be used postoperatively after cesarean section to facilitate involution and resistance to the large inflow of blood. In large animals, oxytocin is used to augment uterine contractions and stimulate lactation. Oxytocin does not increase milk production, but it stimulates contraction, leading to milk ejection. It contracts smooth muscle cells of the mammary gland for milk letdown if the udder is in a proper physiological state. It is also used to expel the placenta after delivery. However, efficacy for retained placenta is questionable, and some experts believe that estrogen should be administered in addition to oxytocin. Oxytocin administered prior to luteolysis (prior to day 10 postovulation in horses) prolongs corpus luteum function and suppresses estrus behavior in mares. In small animals, oxytocin is used as a treatment for nonobstructive dystocia caused by uterine inertia. The efficacy for this use is mostly based on anecdotal accounts from reproduction experts. Based on the mechanism described, it does not increase milk production in bitches or queens, but it may help empty the mammary gland of previously produced milk.

The major use of phenylbutazone is in horses for musculoskeletal pain and inflammation, arthritis, soft tissue injury, and racing injuries. The duration of action in horses after a single administration to horses is approximately 24 hours. Phenylbutazone is approved for use in dogs (and cats in Europe); however, the use in small animals is not common because of the availability of other drugs. P Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Although adverse effects have been documented in horses, after more than 30 years of experience, most equine clinicians have observed good safety with phenylbutazone. Earlier studies that demonstrated common adverse effects may have been exaggerated because the studies were performed in ponies, which is a breed more sensitive than horses, or high doses were used. Likewise, draft horses appear to be more sensitive to adverse effects. Among the adverse effects in horses are GI ulcers, which may be more likely to appear in the glandular region of the equine stomach. Gastric ulcers are more likely\tas\tthe\tdose\tincreases\tand\tin\tanimals\tundergoing\textensive\ttraining.\tHorses may also develop right dorsal colitis and hypoproteinemia, especially at high doses. Phenylbutazone also has been associated with kidney injury. In horses that are dehydrated or have renal compromise, phenylbutazone can cause ischemia and renal papillary necrosis. Renal injury is not common in otherwise healthy horses that are well hydrated. In experimental horses, phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/ kg q12h for 14 days) decreased proteoglycan synthesis in articular cartilage. However,\tthis\teffect\ton\tarticular\tcartilage\twith\tclinical\tuse\thas\tnot\tbeen\ta documented problem. Phenylbutazone is rarely used in people because it has caused bone marrow depression, including aplastic anemia. This effect also has been observed in animals. Phenylbutazone is generally well tolerated in dogs, but there are no data for cats. In these animals, adverse effects possible are GI toxicity such as gastritis and gastric ulcers.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use The doses administered are based primarily on manufacturer’s recommendations and many years of clinical experience in horses. Although a range of 4.4–8.8 mg/ kg per day has been administered to horses, studies have not shown an advantage for the higher dose. The high dosage of 8.8 mg/kg per day is more likely to cause GI injury, hypoalbuminemia, and neutropenia. Generally, a safe starting dose in horses is 4.4 mg/kg q12h IV or PO for 2–3 days. This dose is equivalent to 2 g PO in most horses. Then the dosage should be tapered to 2.2–3.3 mg/kg q12h PO (approximately 1 g per horse). For long- term use, 2.2 mg/kg once daily can be used.

It does not appear to produce any clinical effects in horses from oral administration. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Adverse effects are rare in dogs but have included vomiting, diarrhea, and hyperactive and restless behavior. Amphetamine- like signs can be produced in experimental animals. At high doses in dogs, hyperactivity has been observed (doses greater than 3 mg/kg), which include salivation, panting, repetitive movements, decreased weight, and changes in activity level. At doses of 30 mg per horse IV or PO, there were no behavior effects. Two active metabolites are l- amphetamine  and l- methamphetamine.  Even though there were increases in amphetamine concentrations in dogs, they were not high enough to produce adverse effects at the approved label dose. However, at high doses (greater than 3 mg/kg), it may produce behavioral changes attributed to CNS stimulation. The l- isomer metabolites are not as active as their d forms, and studies have not supported a potential for amphetamine- like abuse or dependency from selegiline compared with other amphetamine- like drugs.",

It also has been used in dogs to relieve bronchoconstriction and in animals with bronchitis and other airway diseases. Is has been useful as an injection to rapidly relieve bronchospasm in small animals associated with inflammatory airway disease or clinical procedures. It has been used in horses for short- term administration, by injection, to relieve bronchoconstriction associated with recurrent airway obstruction (RAO), which is a component of equine asthma syndrome.

There are no well- controlled clinical studies or efficacy trials to document clinical effectiveness in animals. Albuterol injection may be used as an alternative for terbutaline injection (4 mcg/kg bolus up to 8 mcg/kg as needed). Terbutaline is not absorbed by the PO route in horses; therefore, it is not effective in horses for PO administration.

Use carefully in conditions associated with hypocalcemia. The manufacturer warns that horses with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis may be at an increased risk for adverse reactions, including colic signs, hyperkalemic episodes, and death. Do not use in pregnant mares because the safety in pregnancy has not been evaluated. Use in young horses: The manufacturer states that the safety of tiludronate in horses younger than 4 years of age has not been evaluated. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity, which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. It is recommended not to administer bisphosphonates such as tiludronate in young performance horses because the change in bone metabolism may predispose young horses to fracture. In some racing jurisdictions, these drugs are prohibited in horses younger than 4 years of age. One study that examined clodronate and tiludronate in young horses concluded that tiludronate and clodronate did not appear to significantly impact bone tissue on a structural or cellular level using standard dose and administration schedules in young horses.

Alternative drugs also may be used for mast cell tumors, such as vinblastine plus prednisone. During treatment of mast cell tumors, antihistamines (e.g., cetirizine) can also be used to minimize the effects of histamine. Although toceranib is approved for mast cell tumors in dogs, some clinicians have used it to treat adenocarcinoma, melanoma, mammary carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and anal gland adenocarcinoma; however, efficacy for these indications has not yet been established. Toceranib has been used in cats to treat epithelial tumors, squamous cell carcinoma, and mast cell tumors (in combination with corticosteroids). Dosage suggestions are listed later. There is not sufficient information available to document efficacy or safety in cats, but preliminary results were a low overall response rate. T Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Dogs with mast cell tumors often have GI problems associated with the tumor and treatment. Therefore many dogs are treated simultaneously with antihistamines and drugs to suppress stomach acid (e.g., H 2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors). The most common adverse effects are diarrhea, loss of appetite, lameness, musculoskeletal pain, weight loss, and blood in the feces. In people, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been associated with proteinuria, thrombosis, hemorrhage, and systemic hypertension (discussed later). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may cause systemic hypertension in some animals. The mechanism may be related to decreased NO availability. VEGF increases production of NO by endothelial cells, which helps to regulate blood pressure. Decreased NO caused by administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have a potential to cause systemic hypertension. This may occur in dogs, and they should be screened and monitored for this possibility during treatment. Toceranib can disrupt the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis in dogs by decreasing blood flow to the thyroid and altered iodine uptake. Therefore, as noted in the monitoring section, check the T 4 and free T 4 during treatment. Adverse effects in cats are similar as in dogs. These effects include vomiting, decreased appetite, and mild increase in alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase enzymes.",

Within this range, larger dogs can be maintained on lower doses (mg/kg) than smaller dogs. In many dogs, 24- hour cortisol suppression does not occur; therefore, consider administration twice daily in patients that are not adequately controlled to improve clinical response.

        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions Trilostane may decrease synthesis of other adrenocortical hormones besides cortisol. Use cautiously in animals with low potassium concentrations. Do not administer to animals with kidney or liver disease and do not administer to animals intended for breeding. Drug Interactions Use cautiously, if at all, with aldosterone antagonists, such as spironolactone. If administered with ACE inhibitors, there is a risk of hyperkalemia.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Trilostane is used to treat hypercortisolemia associated with pituitary- dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) in dogs (Cushing’s disease). Peak concentrations of trilostane occur at approximately 2–4 hours after an oral dose. Cortisol concentrations will decrease as early as 7–10 days after initiating treatment with trilostane. Trilostane T improves\tpolyuria,\tpolydipsia,\tand\tpolyphagia\tin\t70%–80%\tof\tdogs\twith\tPDH. Treatment with mitotane has been compared with trilostane, and it has been shown that each drug, although acting through different mechanisms, produces similar survival times in dogs with PDH. Other drugs used to treat canine PDH include mitotane (Lysodren), selegiline (Anipryl), and ketoconazole, all drugs acting through different\tmechanisms.\tTreatment\tof\talopecia\tX\tin\tdogs\t(Pomeranians\tand\tpoodles) has been effective in most animals (9–12 mg/kg/day PO). Surprisingly, some dogs do well despite high cortisol concentrations. Explanations for this observation is that it may affect glucocorticoid receptors or may convert cortisol to inactive cortisone in dogs by increasing 11- beta- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Trilostane also has been used to manage clinical signs in dogs with adrenal tumors. Trilostane reduces clinical signs by reducing synthesis of cortisol but does not affect the tumor. The use of trilostane in these cases is palliative. Mitotane may be considered a more effective treatment in these cases. Trilostane also has been effective in cats with hyperadrenocorticism, with no reported adverse effects. Trilostane can decrease clinical signs of hyperadrenocorticism in cats but cannot produce resolution of clinical signs. It can also improve regulation of diabetes, which is often found concurrently in cats with hyperadrenocorticism. In horses, trilostane has been used to treat PPID (equine Cushing’s disease), and there is preliminary evidence of some benefit (improved clinical signs, reduced laminitis, reduced cortisol) from trilostane at a dosage of 1 mg/kg per day PO. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects In some dogs, transient lethargy, decreased appetite, or vomiting has been observed, which may be caused by excessive cortisol suppression. If excessive cortisol suppression has occurred, oral prednisolone or prednisone can be administered, and the dog should improve within 2 hours. When trilostane is again reintroduced in these cases, the dose should be reduced. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid deficiency or development of adrenal gland necrosis has been associated with trilostane treatment. Trilostane may decrease aldosterone in some dogs; therefore, dehydration, weakness, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia are possible and may be observed in some dogs that are sensitive to the mineralocorticoid inhibition. Although the effects of trilostane are ordinarily transient and reversible, some dogs have had irreversible adrenal gland necrosis from trilostane. These dogs must be managed for hypoadrenocorticism and treated with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid supplement. Adverse effects in cats are similar to dogs and include anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, and pancreatitis.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Adjust dose as needed by monitoring cortisol concentrations. Trilostane is a short- acting drug with a peak effect at approximately 4 hours and duration of 8–10 hours. Administer with food if possible because food improves oral absorption. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Monitoring Dogs Monitor cortisol concentrations in treated animals approximately 10–14 days after starting\ttreatment\tand\tthen\tapproximately\tevery\t3\tmonths.\tClinical\tsigns\tsuch as the patient’s thirst, urination habits, appetite, and skin condition also should be monitored during treatment. In most dogs, signs of successful treatment are observed within a few weeks, with improved activity and reduced polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia. Improvements in skin and hair coat may take longer.

(Alternatively, some endocrinologists recommend 2–4 hours after trilostane administration.)

Many endocrinologists round- off\tthese\tvalues\tto\ta\tdesired\trange\tof\tbetween\t2\tand\t6\tmcg/dL\ttested\tafter\t2\tweeks of treatment. If cortisol is too low, consider lowering the dose; if cortisol is too high, consider increasing the dose. Monitor sodium and potassium concentrations in treated dogs. If necessary, supplement with potassium because of aldosterone inhibition. Measurement of endogenous ACTH is not recommended for testing response to trilostane. The levels of ACTH do not correlate with clinical response. Monitoring Cats In cats, start with 1–2 mg/kg per day; then monitor with ACTH stimulation testing.

        "notes": "Instructions for Use Warfarin response can be highly variable among animals. Pharmacokinetic studies have attempted to correlate plasma pharmacokinetics with clinical response (prothrombin time [PT]). However, such a correlation has been difficult to W W demonstrate. A particular dose and plasma concentration that produces an effective prolongation of PT in one patient may not be effective in another individual. Because of the variation in response, adjust doses by monitoring bleeding times in treated animals. For a rapid effect, consider a loading dose of 6 mg per dog once daily for two treatments. Initial doses in cats have ranged from 0.06–0.09 mg/kg (0.25–0.5 mg/cat/day). When dividing tablets for treatment, it is best to crush up a whole tablet into a powder and divide the doses equally from the powder. When tablets are cut into halves or quarters, there may be uneven distribution of warfarin within the tablet. Some fractions of the tablet may contain a higher amount than others. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Adjust the dose by monitoring clotting times because the optimum dose is highly individualistic. The best method to monitor warfarin therapy is with the one- stage PT. PTs are reported in seconds and recorded as a ratio of the PT of the patient to the mean normal PT of the laboratory and as the international normalized ratio (INR). The INR is the most reliable way to monitor the PT, but it may not be available in all laboratories. In animals, the dose is adjusted to maintain PT at 1.5–2 times normal (or an INR of 2–3).

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Xylazine has been used for many years for short- term sedation, anesthesia, and analgesia in horses, dogs, cats, cattle, and exotic animals. Like other alpha 2 agonists, it is used as an anesthetic adjunct and analgesic. The duration of effect is approximately 30 minutes after a bolus injection, but it also may be administered by a CRI for up to 6 hours. Compared with xylazine, dexmedetomidine and medetomidine produce better sedation and analgesia in dogs. Xylazine is used more commonly in large animals for sedation and analgesia than in small animals. Usually, dexmedetomidine is preferred in dogs and cats. Romifidine produces the longest duration of sedative effects followed by detomidine, medetomidine (dexmedetomidine), and xylazine. X Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects In small animals, vomiting is the most common acute effect, which is more prominent in cats than dogs. Xylazine produces sedation and ataxia, which is expected from all alpha 2 agonists. Xylazine, like other alpha 2 agonists, decreases sympathetic output. Cardiovascular depression may occur. Xylazine produces an initial hypertensive phase, followed by a hypotensive phase. Cardiac effects can include sinoatrial block, first-  and second- degree atrioventricular block, bradycardia, and sinus arrhythmia. Like other alpha 2 agonists, xylazine produces transient hyperglycemia, which may increase urine flow. In ruminants, use of xylazine may decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause bloating, salivation, and regurgitation. Note that cattle, sheep, and goats are much more sensitive to xylazine than other animals; therefore doses need to be lower than those in other animals. Among horses, draft horses are more sensitive to the effects than thoroughbred and Arab horses. X",

It is combined with guaifenesin and ketamine in the equine “triple drip” combination (see dosing section, below). Although low heart rates are anticipated with xylazine, it is not necessary to premedicate animals with atropine. For large animals, if sedation is needed without recumbency, use the lower end of the dose range. Reverse effects of xylazine with an alpha 2 antagonist (e.g., yohimbine, tolazoline, or atipamezole) if adverse effects are serious enough to warrant reversal. Xylazine also may be administered intraosseously to horses when it is not possible to give an IV injection. It is equally bioavailable from the intraosseous route as IV.

        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions It has been stated in some veterinary textbooks that acepromazine may increase the risk of seizures in animals, and it should be administered cautiously in animals that are prone to seizures. However, a risk of seizures in animals from administration of acepromazine has not been confirmed during clinical use. Seizures were not reported in retrospective studies in which animals prone to seizures were anesthetized and administered acepromazine as an anesthetic adjunct. Do not use in animals that have problems with dystonia or that have had previous extrapyramidal effects from use of phenothiazines. Dogs with a mutation in the ABCB1 gene (previously listed as MDR1), which is the gene that codes for the p- glycoprotein membrane transporter, are likely to have prolonged and increased sedation after administration of acepromazine. In these dogs, the dose should be decreased or another sedative selected for use. Phenothiazines can cause hypotension (via alpha- receptor blockade); therefore, use cautiously with other hypotensive drugs or in conditions that may exacerbate hypotension. When administered as a pre- anesthetic to dogs (0.05 mg/kg), it induces moderate hypotension but does not affect cardiac output significantly. In pregnancy, it produces only minor reduction in blood flow and oxygen delivery to the fetus when used in late pregnancy in cows. Drug Interactions Specific drug interactions have not been reported from the use of acepromazine in animals. However, it exacerbates the effects of other sedative drugs and may potentiate other drugs that cause vasodilation. Acepromazine has been used to sedate dogs for glucose tolerance testing (0.1 mg/kg), without adversely affecting the results. A Acetaminophen 3",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Acepromazine is used as a sedative, a tranquilizer, a pre- anesthetic, and an anesthetic adjunct. When used as an anesthetic pre- anesthetic, it induces muscle relaxation and lowers doses of anesthetic agents used concurrently. In pre- anesthetic protocols, it also may have some anti- arrhythmic effects. In small animals, duration of sedation can occur within 10 minutes and have a 4-  to 6- hour duration. In small animals, acepromazine can produce antiemetic effects via dopaminergic blockade. Acepromazine produces arterial smooth muscle relaxation by inhibiting alpha 1 receptor–mediated constriction. This effect is used to increase blood flow to tissues, particularly in the metatarsal artery of horses, and produces increased blood flow to the palmar digital artery. This is used for the treatment of horses with laminitis. Acepromazine has been used as a behavior- modifying agent in animals (e.g., to treat anxiety). However, there are other agents that are preferred for long- term management of behavior disorders in animals that have fewer adverse effects. It should not be used as a first choice to decrease stress in hospitalized animals because there are other preferred agents available. Acepromazine does not provide analgesic activity. A Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Sedation and ataxia are common side effects. Extrapyramidal effects (involuntary muscle movements), twitching, dystonia, or Parkinson- like effects are rare but are possible with the administration of phenothiazines to animals. Acepromazine may produce paradoxical excitation, disinhibition, and aggression in some dogs. Phenothiazines may produce excessive vagal tone in some animals. This may be especially prominent in brachycephalic breeds. Administration of atropine may be used to treat the signs of high vagal tone. Because of alpha- adrenergic antagonism, hypotension is possible in animals. Decreased vascular tone because of alpha 1 adrenergic blockade is a prominent effect of acepromazine. This may produce hypotension in susceptible animals.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use Acepromazine can be administered PO, IV, or IM. The doses used in anesthetic protocols are usually lower than the label dose. When used with general anesthetics, lower doses of general anesthetics can be used, especially when administering barbiturates and inhalant anesthetics. Clinical signs from acepromazine administration are most prominent during the first 3–4 hours after administration but may persist for 7 hours. Patient Monitoring and Laboratory Tests Monitor blood pressure in animals susceptible to hypotension. Acepromazine does not affect adrenal function testing in dogs. Dogs with a mutation in the ABCB1 gene may be deficient for the ABCB1 transporter (p- glycoprotein). These dogs may have increased sensitivity to the effects of acepromazine, resulting in greater sedation scores. Lower doses should be used in these dogs. In horses, persistent penile prolapse has been reported from use. This effect in horses is unpredictable. Some resources indicate that it is dose dependent with increased likelihood as the dose is increased from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg IV. The duration of penile prolapse in horses may be as long as 4 hours with high doses. In rare cases, penile prolapse can lead to permanent paraphimosis. The mechanism is unknown but may be caused by the alpha- adrenergic blockade induced by acepromazine.

The dose necessary to stimulate seizures and produce cardiac arrhythmias in dogs is greater than 4 mg/kg, IV. After epidural administration, respiratory paralysis is possible with high doses. The liposomal formulation injected into surgical sites may produce occasional tissue irritation, but systemic absorption of the liposomal suspension is negligible and far below the concentrations necessary to induce CNS effects such as seizures.

        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions Cats are more susceptible to adverse effects, and lower doses should be used. For example, the CRI in cats is lower than the rate in dogs. Absorption from lidocaine patches in cats is only 6.3% and is not expected to present a problem. In animals with decreased blood flow to the liver (e.g., animals under anesthesia), clearance may be reduced and the risk of adverse effects increased. Drug Interactions Lidocaine hydrochloride is maintained as an acidic solution for solubility. Although short- term mixing with alkaline solutions may not interfere with stability (i.e., immediately prior to administration), storage in alkalinizing solutions can cause precipitation. If mixed with alkalinizing solutions, it should be administered promptly.",
        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Lidocaine is used commonly as a local anesthetic and for treatment and conversion of ventricular arrhythmias. Lidocaine should be used cautiously for treating supraventricular arrhythmias because it may increase cardiac conduction. Lidocaine has been used on a limited basis to treat seizures that are refractory to other drugs. Lidocaine also is used for pain management. It has been administered as a CRI in animals, especially in postsurgical patients to improve recovery after intestinal or gastric surgery. Lidocaine has been combined with other analgesics, which may be synergistic and allow lower doses of each individual\tcomponent.\tOne\texample\tof\ta\tcombination\tis\tMLK,\twhich\tis\tmorphine\t(or fentanyl), lidocaine, and ketamine (see dosing section for formula). In horses, lidocaine infusions delivered by CRI may help to restore intestinal motility and are used to treat intestinal ileus. In dogs, when it was delivered as a CRI, there was no change in gastric emptying, and there were modest effects to increase intestinal motility. Lidocaine has been applied to animals as a transdermal patch. The patch (designed for people) is 5% strength and used primarily for neuropathic pain (postherpetic neuralgia). This patch also has been applied for some conditions in dogs and cats with anecdotal accounts of some success. Absorption from the patch is low (less than 5%), which is far below the threshold for toxic effects. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects High doses of lidocaine cause CNS effects (tremors, twitches, and seizures) and vomiting, but the risk of lidocaine- induced seizures is low. IV use and CRIs in horses have caused muscle fasciculations, rapid eye blinking, anxiety, ataxia, weakness, and seizures. Lidocaine can produce cardiac arrhythmias, but it has greater effect on abnormal cardiac tissue than normal tissue. Use lidocaine cautiously in cats. IV doses of lidocaine in cats have resulted in death. In cats under anesthesia, lidocaine administration has caused decreased cardiac output, cardiovascular depression, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. In cats, lidocaine has also produced methemoglobinemia and hemolysis.",
        "notes": "Instructions for Use When used for local infiltration, many formulations contain epinephrine to prolong activity at the injection site. Avoid using formulations that contain epinephrine in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Note that human formulations may contain epinephrine, but no veterinary formulations contain epinephrine. To increase pH, speed onset of action, and decrease pain from injection, one may add 1 mEq of sodium bicarbonate to 10 mL of lidocaine (use immediately after mixing). To prepare solutions for infusion in horses, mix 10 g of 2% lidocaine in 3 L of lactated Ringer’s solution (0.33% solution). For treating ventricular arrhythmia in horses, consider adding magnesium sulfate to the infusion. See dosing instructions below for the magnesium sulfate dose.

        "contraindications": "Contraindications and Precautions Propofol can induce apnea, hypoxia, and cyanosis upon induction. Supplemental oxygen should be available to prevent adverse effects. Do not administer to hypotensive animals without providing fluids to correct hypotension. When propofol has been used to sedate animals for intradermal skin testing, it may produce a greater number of positive reactions. The use of propofol in pregnant and breeding animals has not been evaluated. Propofol crosses the placenta and can cause neonatal depression. Propofol has not been evaluated in dogs younger than 10 weeks of age. Propofol should not be used alone for anesthesia in horses—combine with other sedatives or premedications. Drug Interactions Propofol can be used with several other anesthetics and adjuncts safely. It has been mixed\t   with\t  thiopental\tsodium\t(2.5%)\t   in\t a\t 1:1\t  mixture\twithout\tloss\t  of\t effectiveness. Propofol has been used with atropine, glycopyrrolate, acepromazine, xylazine, oxymorphone, halothane, and isoflurane without any interactions observed. without a preservative are used, there should be careful handling and injection technique to prevent microbial contamination of this formulation.

        "indications": "Indications and Clinical Uses Propofol is used as a short- term injectable anesthetic. It is often used as an induction agent followed by inhalation with one of the inhalant anesthetics, or induction may be followed with maintenance doses. If repeated doses are administered for maintenance, it does not affect the recovery time. Thus, there is no cumulative effect. It has been used safely and effectively for short- term induction and surgical procedures. It is also appropriate for procedures that require repeated anesthetic episodes in dogs and cats without producing adverse effects. A significant advantage of propofol over other agents is smooth and rapid recovery. It is also highly compatible with other anesthetic agents. It can be used with acepromazine, diazepam, alpha 2 agonists (e.g., dexmedetomidine), butorphanol, ketamine, and inhalant anesthetics. The use of these other agents will lower the dose requirement for propofol. Propofol also can be used as a CRI to maintain an anesthetized state for surgical procedures. (See infusion dose rates later.) An additional use of propofol is treatment of status epilepticus. Precautionary Information",
        "side_effects": "Adverse Reactions and Side Effects Apnea and respiratory depression are the most common adverse effects, which are more likely at high doses. Propofol can induce a dose- dependent cardiovascular depression, but the severity of cardiac adverse events is generally low. Propofol can induce vasodilation, which can be minimized by providing sufficient IV fluids during the induction period and during anesthesia. Propofol can cause spontaneous muscle movements (paddling, tremors, muscle rigidity), panting, nystagmus, salivation, and retraction of tongue in some animals (incidence 3%–7%). Less frequent adverse reactions include vomiting during recovery and signs of pain. Pain upon injection occurs in people but is less common in dogs. The pain from injection is caused by the free propofol in the formulation and is decreased with newer formulations. Phenolic drugs such as propofol may potentially cause oxidative damage to hemoglobin in cats because of higher concentration of oxidizable\tsulfhydryl\tgroups\tin\tfeline\tRBCs,\tleading\tto\tHeinz-\tbody\tformation and\tmethemoglobinemia.\tHowever,\tthis\thas\tnot\tbeen\ta\tconsistent\tproblem\twith routine clinical use of propofol, and repeated anesthetic episodes have been performed safely in cats.
